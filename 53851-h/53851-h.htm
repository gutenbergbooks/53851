<span class="smaller">THE CITY OF PRIDE</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-k.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">King</span> Antiochus, self-styled Epiphanes,
the Glorious, was in a humor that ill-suited
that title. He cursed his scribe
who had just read to him a letter,
kicked away the cushions where his
royal and gouty feet had been resting, and strode
about the chamber declaring that, by all the gods!
he would make such a show in Antioch that the
whole world would be agog with amazement.</p>

<p>The letter which exploded the temper of his majesty
was from Philippi, in Macedonia, and told how the
Romans, those insolent republicans of the West,
had made a magnificent fête to commemorate
their conquest of the country of Perseus, the last of
the kings of Greece.</p>

<p>Epiphanes was a compound of pusillanimity and
conceit. He could forget the insult offered by a
Roman officer who drew about "The Glorious" a
circle in the sand, and threatened to thrash the
kingship out of him if he did not at once desist from
a certain attempt upon Egypt; but he could not endure
that another should outshine him in the pomp
for which Antioch was famous. This Eagle of Syria,
as he liked to be called, would rather have his talons
cut than lose any of his plumage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence that great oath of the king. So loud and
ominous was it that the pet jackanapes sprang to
the shoulder of the statue of the Syrian Venus, and
clung with his hairy arms about her marble neck.
The giant guardsmen in the adjacent court, who,
half asleep, stood leaning upon their pikes, were
startled into spasmodic motion, and shouldered their
weapons, before their contemptuous glances showed
that they understood the words that rang out to
them.</p>

<p>"By all the gods! if Rome has the power, and
Alexandria the commerce, Antioch shall be queen in
splendor, though it takes all the gold of all the
provinces to dress her."</p>

<p>The scribe smiled blandly and bowed his appreciation
of this new-coming glory of his master. The
jackanapes took heart, and, after annihilating some
of his own personal enemies with vigorous scratching
of his haunches, leaped from the statue to the arm of
the King's chair. So the grand pageant was ordered.</p>

<p>All the world was invited to the Syrian capital.
For an entire month such splendors and sports were
seen at Daphne, the famous pleasure-grounds near to
Antioch, that ever after the capital was called Epidaphne,
the City by the Grove. The heights of
Silpius, on whose lower slope Antioch lay like a
jewel in the lap of a queen, blazed by day with a
thousand banners, and at night with fires whose reflection
turned the Orontes that flowed below the
city into a stream of molten gold.</p>

<p>One day was devoted to military display. There
were fifty thousand soldiers of many nations, from
the perfectly formed Greek of the Peloponnesus to
the Persian, who made up for his lack of muscle by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the superior glitter of his spear, and the lithe and
swarthy Arabs from all the deserts between the
Ægean and the Euphrates. Plumes of gold nodded
above shields of bronze and silver. Hundreds of
chariots glowed like rainbows in their parti-colored
enamel, and were drawn by horses buckled and
bossed with precious gems. Droves of elephants
armored in dazzling steel carried upon their backs
howdahs like thrones.</p>

<p>A stalwart young Greek stood looking at this
martial display. He wore the chiton, or under-garment,
cut short above the knees, and belted at the
loins, where hung a stout sword indicating that he
too was a soldier.</p>

<p>"What think you, Dion?" asked a comrade.</p>

<p>"Why, that the body-guard of our King Perseus,
though numbering but three thousand, could have
annihilated this whole mongrel horde as readily as
Alexander did the million when he won this land for
his degenerate successors. But I must not criticise
the service I am enrolled to enter."</p>

<p>Following the soldiery in the procession came a
thousand young men, each wearing a crown of
seeming gold, clad in glistening white silk, and holding
aloft a huge tusk of ivory. These symboled the
trade wealth of Syria.</p>

<p>But the army having passed by, the Greek was
soon wearied with the rest of the display; and, bidding
his companion farewell, with a few sage suggestions
about the temptations of the Grove at
night, such as one young fellow might give another,
went into the city.</p>

<p>The second day's festivities were of a less valiant,
though not less fascinating sort. It was the Day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Beauty. Hundreds of fair women, in balconies that
overhung the narrow streets of the city, or grouped
upon platforms here and there throughout the
Grove, flung into the air the dust of sandalwood
and other spiceries, or sprinkled the crowds with
drops of aromatic ointments. At the crossing of the
paths were great vessels of nard and cinnamon and
oils, scented with marjoram and lily, that even the
paupers might delight themselves with the perfume
of princes. Tanks of wine and tables spread with
viands were as free as they were costly.</p>

<p>But the King himself was the most extravagant
provision of the show. In him the dignity of a king
was less than the vanity of the man: his coxcomb
more than his crown. It cut him to the quick that
a courtier should outdress him, a charioteer better
manage his steeds, or a fakir set the mouths of the
crowd more widely gaping. In the military procession
yesterday he had sat between the tusks of an
enormous elephant, and pricked the brute's trunk
with a golden prod. He had also ridden a famous
stallion,&mdash;tightly curbed, it is true, and flanked by
six athletic grooms.</p>

<p>His majesty's originality was especially shown
on the Day of Beauty by his riding beside Clarissa,
the famous dancer, in the chariot where she
reclined as Queen of the Grove, an apparition of
Astarte herself. The extemporized divinity of love
wore a moon-shaped tiara of silver, the symbol of
the Queen of Heaven; Epiphanes put on an aureole
of gold to represent the glory of the Sun. A score of
women whose forms were familiar to all the frequenters
of the dancing gardens of Daphne lay at
their feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Dion was an onlooker. He had caught so much of
the spirit of the day as to curl his locks and drape
a purple himation or outer cloak from his left shoulder.</p>

<p>"That's the Macedonian," said one of Clarissa's
satellites, as from her float she spied the graceful
form in the crowd.</p>

<p>"A perfect Apollo!" was the critical response,
which drew a jealous glance from even The Glorious,
who made the unkingly comment:</p>

<p>"No. His nose isn't true. Has the snout of a
Jew."</p>

<p>His Majesty deserved to hear, though he did not,
the comment the Greek was at the same moment
making to his comrade:</p>

<p>"Humph! Epiphanes, the Glorious! Well do the
people call him Epimanes, the Fool."</p>

<p>Captain Dion, notwithstanding the contemptuous
sentiments thus far awakened by the great show,
was an observer the day following; for the spectacular
greatness of the affair would have drawn a
Diogenes into the crowd.</p>

<p>This was All-Gods Day. The various deities of the
nations which Epiphanes' fathers had conquered for
him, and those of lands which the ambitious monarch
claimed, though he had not yet subdued them,&mdash;these
were represented by their statues, or by living
personages who were apparelled in celestial hues;
that is, so far as the King's costumers were acquainted
with the fashions of the world beyond the
clouds.</p>

<p>One float bore a tableau in which Mount Olympus
appeared, peopled with divinities, among whom
Jupiter sat with uplifted hand holding a sheaf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
golden spears for lightning bolts, which the shaking
of the float made to menace the spectators with
celestial ire. A bull-headed Moloch of brass was contributed
by the adjacent Ph&oelig;nician city of Sidon;
this was followed by a stone Winged Bull from
Babylon.</p>

<p>Lesser divinities held their court before the gaping
crowds, as if heaven were trailing its banners
beneath the greater glory of the earthly monarch.
Indeed, the vanity of Epiphanes did not hesitate to
make this monstrous pretension. He was magnificently
enthroned, his head canopied by a device in
which a golden sun and silvery planets were made
to float through fleecy azure. At his feet on a lower
platform were priests representing every religion in
his wide domain&mdash;those of the Ph&oelig;nician Baal in
white robes with fluted skirts slashed diagonally
with violet scarfs, their heads covered with close-fitting
caps of knitted hair-work, as if of a piece
with their black beards; Greek priests with gloomy
brows inspecting the entrails of the sacrifice; and
naked Bacchantes, crowned with the leaves of the
vine.</p>

<p>Among these sacred officials was Menelaos, the
High Priest of the Jews, clad in the beauty of the
ancient pontificate; his white tunic partly covered
with the blue robe; his head surmounted with the
flower-shaped turban. Menelaos was not the rightful
High Priest of his people. His brother, the
sainted Onias, had held that office, until, after long
captivity in the prison of Daphne, he was murdered
by Menelaos' order, not far from the spot the fratricide
was now passing.</p>

<p>As on the previous days, Dion, the Macedonian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had his station as a spectator on the raised platform
by the splendid gate of Daphne. By his side
was a young man. He was of decided Jewish countenance,
of slight form, head uncovered except for
the silver band which held his artificially curled hair
close down upon his forehead&mdash;the fashion of Antiochian
fops of the time; from his shoulders a yellow
himation buckled with an enormous jewel and
cornered with purple devices.</p>

<p>"I take it, Glaucon," said Dion, "that you are in
feather with the High Priest of your people. If I
mistook it not, you gave him a knowing nod, which
he would have returned had not his pose at the feet
of the King prevented."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Jew, "Menelaos and I are good
friends. And well we may be, for, next to his own,
my family is the noblest in Jerusalem. Menelaos has
great influence with the King, and has brought me
into much favor in Antioch."</p>

<p>"Such favor you will doubtless need, if reports be
true," replied Dion. "They say that General Apollonius
has made your city of Jerusalem a butcher's
pen. That surely might have been avoided, since
Menelaos, and your house&mdash;the house of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The house of Elkiah, the Nasi," quickly interjected
Glaucon.</p>

<p>The Greek continued: "Since such great families
as yours have been induced to accept the lordship of
Antioch, why not all others? I fear that Apollonius
is given to the wearing of the bones on the outside
of his hand."</p>

<p>"Well he may be," replied Glaucon, "for my people
are obdurate,&mdash;stupidly so. Many of them are
crazed with their religious bigotry. For the precept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of some dead Rabbi they would live in the tombs.
They would cut off their flesh rather than part with
a traditional hem of the garment. They are so
proud that one of them would not marry Astarte
herself. But a few of us are wiser. We are going to
introduce the Greek customs which are so beautiful
and joyous; learn your philosophy; adorn our
Temple with your art. Young Jewry hears the call
of the Greek civilization, as does all the rest of the
world. Old Jewry is soured with its traditions, as
milk is from too long standing."</p>

<p>"I am glad that I am not a Jew," replied Dion.
"I fear that my love of fight would make me a
rebel."</p>

<p>"Not you, Captain Dion," said the Jew, looking
with admiration into the Greek's handsome face and
his blue eyes, that were as full of frolic as of fire.
"You, Dion, could fight for a woman, if she were
beautiful; but not for a gray-walled temple, and a
lot of psalm-snoring priests."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Dion, "I shall soon have a chance
to study your strange people; for I am ordered by
the King to join Apollonius. I sail to-morrow on
the <i>Eros</i>, from the harbor of Seleucia to Joppa."</p>

<p>"Then I am in high luck," replied the Jew enthusiastically,
"since I will have you for a fellow-passenger.
One night more in Daphne! I assure
you that I shall play the true Greek, and fill myself
with the best that is left in Antioch, since to-morrow
I pay tribute to Neptune. You will join me at sunset,
Captain? Celanus' wines are excellent."</p>

<p>"Impossible," replied Dion. "I must keep my legs
steady under me, and my brain-pan level, for to-morrow
I shall have to take charge of a hundred of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the most villainous wretches that the King ever got
together. And he calls them 'Greek soldiers,' though
there isn't a man of them that can tell his race two
generations back. A lot of pirates, robbers, mine-slaves,
and old wine-skins on legs! Greek soldiers!
When Mars turns chambermaid to a stable we
Greeks will be such soldiers. But they may be good
enough for the work that Apollonius has for them
in Jerusalem. Farewell! To-morrow at noon on
deck!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Even a king must sometimes work. So Antiochus,
the Glorious, laid aside the trappings of divinity and
attended to business. A vast empire, such as he had
inherited through several generations from Alexander
the Great, needed care. So far as possible the
King farmed out the government of the provinces to
those who would return the largest revenue, and
trouble him least about the method of their gathering
it. Yet something was left for even the King to
do.</p>

<p>First in the royal interest, after he had returned to
his palace, was the report of the chief of the city
spies&mdash;old Briareus, he fondly called him, since he
was as one that had a hundred arms, and a thousand
fingers on them, which were in all the private
affairs of the inhabitants of the capital. Having
satisfied himself with his chief's account, and feeling
confident that the royal throat was in no immediate
danger of being cut by any of the multitude he was
daily outraging, the King turned to less interesting
matters, such as the whereabouts of his many
armies, their victories and defeats.</p>

<p>"Your tablets, Timon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The scribe read:</p>

<p>"Apollonius reports all quiet at Jerusalem. Executed
two hundred yesterday."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the King. "Bid him leave not so
much as a ghost of a Jew above Hades; and then
let him hasten the work in the country to the north.
The Jewish peasants are unsubdued. It is not safe
for a single company of our troops to go over land
to Judea. I have had to send the detachment tomorrow
by water down the coast."</p>

<p>"There is the matter of Glaucon, son of the Nasi.
You recall your Majesty's promise to spare his
property. It was a part of the bargain with Menelaos,
the Priest."</p>

<p>"To Hades with the Priest!" cried the King.</p>

<p>"Would it be wise to break with Menelaos?"
timidly suggested the scribe.</p>

<p>"You are right, Timon. The High Priest will be
convenient in Jerusalem,&mdash;like the handle to a blade.
Has Menelaos paid up all he promised?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the nine hundred talents are safe."</p>

<p>"Nine hundred talents! That rascal must have
robbed the Temple."</p>

<p>"Well, if he did, it will save your Majesty the
trouble of finding the hidden coffers. They say that
the old King Solomon put his gold into wells as
deep as the earth, and that only the High Priest
knows where they are."</p>

<p>"A good thought!" said the Glorious, thumping
the bald head of the scribe with the royal seal.
"Your skull, Timon, is as full of wisdom as a beggar's
is of fleas. When Menelaos has gobbled down
all the gold there is in Jerusalem, we will open his
crop and let out the shekels, as they do corn grains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from a turkey's gullet. A good thought! But
enough of these things. They tire me. Business is
for slaves, not for kings. Did you note to-day how
the people looked as I appeared in the procession?"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty's glory can but grow upon the
multitude. It is like that of a mountain,&mdash;of a sunset&mdash;of&mdash;of
the Great Sea when the glowing orb of
day with rays like the dishevelled hair&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, good Timon; no flattery. You know I
never could abide flattery."</p>

<p>"No words could flatter your Majesty." The
scribe bowed upon the marble floor, and kissed the
feet of his master.</p>

<p>"Now begone," said the King. "Let everything be
ready for to-night. Clarissa, the Queen of the Grove,
comes with a troop of her dancers."</p>

<p>With a wave of the royal hand the scribe vanished,
and instead came the King's costumers and physician;
for the body of the Glorious must be re-apparelled,
and his stomach put in order for feasting.</p>

<h2>II<br />

<span class="smaller">THE CITY OF DESOLATION</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> streets of Jerusalem in every age
have been thronged with the same
motley multitude: cool-looking, white-shirted
market venders from the stalls;
no shirted sweat-hot artisans from the
cellar workshops; dyers, designated by their badges
of bright-colored threads; tailors, in heraldry of
ornamented needles; carpenters, wearing their symbol
of square and compass&mdash;of which they were as
proud as the scribe was of the pen stuck behind his
ear; fishermen from Galilee and the coast jostling the
fruiterers with great baskets on their heads; bare-legged,
dirt-tanned laborers from the fields; half-naked
children of either sex, playing with equal carelessness
whether they knocked over the piles of fruit
and black bread that stood upon the stone pavement,
or were themselves knocked over by the sharp
hoofs of asses or the spongy feet of camels. These
exponents of common, toiling humanity made way
for the gay tunic-clad aristocrats of the Upper City
of Sion, white-robed priests from the Temple Mount,
gray-sheeted women from the Cheesemakers Street,
and ladies in black silken garments and caps of
coins, who were borne in palanquins from the more
fashionable Street of David.</p>

<p>But in the year 167 before our Era all these had
disappeared,&mdash;as suddenly and completely as the sea-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>mullets
and blackfish are driven out of the shallows
in the bay of Joppa by an invasion of sharks.</p>

<p>The costumes and speech of the new crowd on the
streets were foreign, chiefly those of Greek and Syrian
soldiers, with broad-brimmed hats, loose-knit,
iron-linked corsage, tight leather leggings, and short,
stout cleaver-like swords hanging from their girdles.
Here and there one stood stock still, sentinelling his
corner of the street, with the point of his sarissa or
long spear gleaming ten cubits above his head, while
his broad circular shield held abreast made an eddy
in the living current as it swept around him. These
were the soldiers of Antiochus Epiphanes.</p>

<p>Mingled with them were many foreign civilians, as
their dress indicated; merchants whose belts were
well filled with gold to purchase what the soldiers
might steal; colonists to resettle the lands from
which the conquered people were expelled; and
hordes of hucksters and harlots who followed the
armies of the time as dust clouds come after
chariots.</p>

<p>Nor were there wanting in the crowd those whose
curved noses contradicted the disguise of their newly
cropped hair, and proclaimed them to be renegade
Jews: men who preferred to retain their ancestral
property by denying the faith of their fathers.</p>

<p>One afternoon the crowd in the Street of David
became suddenly congested. Through it a man, venerable
with age, was vainly trying to make his
way. His long white locks, which curled downward
in front of his ears and mingled with the
snowy beard upon his bosom, betokened his Jewish
race; while the broad fringes of white and hyacinth
upon his outer garment designated him as one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Chasidim or Purists, who preferred to part with
their blood rather than with their religion. The
old patriot made no retort to the jostling and gibes
of the crowd, but his deep-set eyes flashed hatred
from beneath their shaggy brows, and told of the
tragedy in his soul even more eloquently than if his
lips had poured forth fiery speech.</p>

<p>"You can't swim up this stream, old man," said a
soldier, giving the frail form a twirl that made it
face the other way.</p>

<p>"It is the Nasi himself, Chief of the Rabbis,"
whispered a young Jew in Greek cloak to a soldier.
"Herakles club me, if you haven't caught the biggest
rat left in the hole. But Apollonius has given protection
to the Nasi's house. Be careful."</p>

<p>"Protection to his house! Why then did he come
out of it? Fetch him along. Strip him naked, and
warm his toad's blood in the new gymnasium."</p>

<p>With this insult the soldier tore the outer garment
from the old man's back. The Jew was dazed for
the instant by the Greek's audacity, and mumbled
within his sunken lips the words of the Prophet:
"I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheek to
them that plucked off the hair."</p>

<p>He then raised his eyes heavenward, apparently
unconscious of a staggering blow between his shoulders
from the flat of a sword. He stood a moment
until he had completed the sacred sentence: "For
the Lord God shall help me; therefore shall I not be
confounded; therefore have I set my face like a
flint."</p>

<p>"'Face like a flint,' does he say? Let's see if it
will strike fire like a flint," shouted one, smiting the
old patriot on the mouth with the palm of his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>This dastardly deed drew blood which stained his
white beard. But it brought a quick retaliation
from an unexpected direction; for a blow like that
of a catapult fell upon the assailant's head.</p>

<p>"By the thunderbolt of Zeus! that made you see
fire," cried a comrade, as the coward reeled into his
arms. "Captain Dion's fist is as heavy as the hammer
of Hephæstus, the blacksmith of the gods, and
makes the sparks fly as well. I'll wager, Ajax, that
you saw the sky full of stars, or else your head is
harder than an anvil."</p>

<p>By the side of the venerable Jew now stood a
young Greek officer. If Hephæstus had need of an
assistant blacksmith the shoulders of Dion would
have attracted his notice; yet it is doubtful if the
goddesses of Olympus would have allowed so graceful
a man to be consigned to the celestial workshop.
His face, too, was peculiarly attractive.
Topped with a brush of light hair and lighted by
his blue eyes, it was beautiful, but without a trace
of femininity; a blending of dignity, intelligence,
courage, and kindly feeling, though the latter quality
was just then outglowed by rage.</p>

<p>On his well-curled head was a chaplet of myrtle,
for he was returning as victor in the day's sports
at the new gymnasium which, as an intended insult
to the religious prejudices of the people, the
Governor, Apollonius, had recently built against the
southern wall of the Temple plaza.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Dion! If you had hit the Theban boxer
yesterday like that, they wouldn't have called for
another round."</p>

<p>Dion faced the crowd, and with utmost detestation
in his voice, exclaimed: "If I had been here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
yesterday, this crew of cowardly knaves had not
hanged the babes to their mothers' necks, and
thrown them from the walls. Let one of you garlic
chewers dare confess any part in that beastly
business, and I will heave him over the walls into
Gehenna, where other carcasses rot. Who touched
those women?"</p>

<p>As Dion looked from face to face his blue eyes
flashed like the sword-point of a fencer feeling for
an exposed spot in the breast of his antagonist.
The challenge was not taken, one venturing to
say:</p>

<p>"It was done at the Governor's orders."</p>

<p>"I pronounce that a lie. Who repeats it?" cried
Captain Dion.</p>

<p>A fellow-officer suggested that it might have been
ordered by Apollonius, since the women had plainly
broken the new law and had circumcised their brats.</p>

<p>"Shame on you, comrade!" said Dion. "They
were women and mothers, and I would say as
much to the King's face."</p>

<p>The old Jew, hearing the reference to the scene
which he himself had been compelled the day before
to witness, turned boldly to the crowd of Greeks,
and, with uplifted hands, repeated this imprecation
from one of the Psalms of his people:</p>

<p>"Let your children be fatherless and your wives
be widows! Let your children be vagabonds
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Dion's hand was firmly laid upon the speaker's
mouth.</p>

<p>"Nay, hold your breath, old man. If you give us
much of it that way, this crowd will take the rest
of it with the hangman's rope."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Dion gently took the Jew's arm. "You must go
back to your house. Come, I will see you safely
within doors, if you will stay there."</p>

<p>"No, I will go to the house of the Lord, and
worship, for it is the ninth hour," replied the determined
man.</p>

<p>"That you cannot do," said Dion, kindly. "Don't
you see that the Temple gate is burned, and that
soldiers are guarding the opening? Your worship
is no longer permitted there. Your sort of priests
are all gone."</p>

<p>"Then," said the patriot, "I will be my own
priest. Surely the Lord will accept an old man's
last worship on earth before he goes hence."</p>

<p>"Nay, my good man, but the priests of the new
religion are at the Temple. To-morrow they celebrate
the feast of Bacchus. If you go there, they
will crown you with ivy, and make you drunk in
honor of the god. You must go home, and stay
within doors."</p>

<p>"Then let me go&mdash;to my own house! My God!
Why was it not my sepulchre ere I saw what the
Prophet foretold?"</p>

<p>Captain Dion led him safely along the Street of
David, the crowd giving way as it gazed upon the
two and remarked the contrast between the half-mummied
saint and the strong-limbed, festive-crowned
youth.</p>

<p>"Old Elkiah is about the last of this damnable
race left in Jerusalem. It is a wonder that Apollonius
has given him tether so long."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Dion knows the Jew," responded some
one. "The captain is as good a Greek as ever drew
sword or loved a woman, but his nose isn't straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
on a line with his forehead. See, it has a Jewish
twist."</p>

<p>"A fine observation," laughed another, "for one
always follows his nose, and that may account for
Dion's kindness to some of these rebels."</p>

<p>"Don't insult Captain Dion!" said one. "He's
close in with Apollonius. Besides, he's a good fellow.
He always gives a weaker man his handicap
in the arena without having it ordered."</p>

<p>"True, or you would not have won yesterday.
But I wish he wouldn't interfere with the sport of
the men. I know that it is cruel, but the sooner
the bigots are exterminated the sooner it will cease.
Were it not for Dion's friendship for that Glaucon&mdash;as
Elkiah's fool of a son now calls himself&mdash;we would
soon find out what the old Jew's house has for us.
They say his cellar is as good as a gold-mine."</p>

<p>"Better kill off Glaucon, and let the old man die
himself. You saw that his life is about burned out,
and his old body only like a heap of ashes with a
spark in it," was the humane response.</p>

<p>Dion paused by the oaken door in the wall of the
Jew's house. He took from a little pouch at his belt
a pinch of aromatic sawdust of sandalwood, and
dropped it upon a small square altar whose brazier
emitted a thin curl of white smoke, clouding the entrance.
This was an altar to Zeus which the Governor
had commanded to be placed at all the houses
which were still occupied by the Jews. Just above
the altar the lintel had been torn by the destruction
of the Mezuzah or wooden box which, according to
the Hebrew custom, contained the sacred sentences
from the Law, and through the small apertures in
which a visitor to any Jewish home could see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
word "Shaddai," the Almighty One, and thus make
the common salutation, "Peace be to this house,"
into a prayer. Dion's worship at the little altar by
the gate was marred by a muttered curse upon
Apollonius for the needless insult perpetrated by this
act of sacrilege.</p>

<p>The Greek had scarcely time to knock at the outer
entrance when the door flew open, and with the cry
"Father!" a young girl's arms were about the old
man.</p>

<p>She drew him inside, and stood with her left arm
supporting, while she raised her right hand as if it
were a shield to protect him.</p>

<p>Captain Dion was familiar with the finest statuary
in Athens and Antioch, but thought he had never
seen anything to match this,&mdash;the white head and
beard of age shielded by the raven locks of youth
and beauty. He would tell Laertes, his sculptor
friend, of this pose.</p>

<p>The girl was apparently about seventeen years of
age, tall and lithe, with sufficient muscle to give that
exquisite grace which only accompanies strength.
Her hair, bound about the temples with a single fillet
of silver, fell in wavy profusion of jet black upon a
white linen chiton. This was gathered at the shoulders,
and left fully exposed a neck which might have
illuminated a copy of Solomon's Song. Beneath the
breasts the garment was girdled with a rope of
golden threads, and thence fell below the knees.
Her ankles were wound with long white sandal
lacings, which were in harmony with the silver band
that bound her brow. Her arms were bare. In her
haste she had not put on her outer garment, and
thus stood revealed in a more exquisite modelling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
nature than she would have chosen had she known
that she was to be beneath so critical an eye. Yet
she could not have been more charming had she
practised for hours before her mirror of polished
brass, and passed her proud old nurse Huldah's
inspection before she made her début at the gate.</p>

<p>Dion noted that the girl's features were perfect,
but strictly on the Semitic model. Her face might
be a hard one, for it well fitted the tragic feeling of
the moment; or it might be sweet as any he had
loved to dream about, for it also fitted the intensity
of filial affection and solicitude she now displayed.
The Greek seemed transfixed by her eyes. These
were enlarged by her surprise, and their pupils
gleamed from their deep black irises with the fire of
excitement.</p>

<p>"A Jewish Athena!" thought Dion, as in a brief
sentence or two he begged the girl to be more prudent
in the care of her father. Surely there was no
scorn of the Jewish race in the profound bow with
which he took his departure, nor in the hasty glance
he stole as the door was closing.</p>

<p>He plucked a leaf from his myrtle crown and
dropped it upon the altar. As he went away he
sighed a prayer for the maiden, and grumbled another
curse upon the King's cruelty. Then he whistled
a sort of musical accompaniment to his thought,
which ran something like this:</p>

<p>"That girl is Glaucon's sister. He never told me
that he had one." He shrugged his shoulders.
"Well, in that he was wise, since he only knows me
for a Greek adventurer, and thinks my honor like his
own, a spur on the heel, to be used or not according
to one's inclination. But, by the arm of Aphrodite!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
what a woman! Beautiful as a lioness, and as
brave too. Strange that the Jew could be father of
both her and Glaucon&mdash;of a lioness and a jackal!
Glaucon and I must be good friends, though I despise
the fool. Why doesn't he fight for his house?
I would&mdash;especially with that woman in it."</p>

<p>Dion stopped and stood a long time looking at the
narrow strip of sky visible between Elkiah's house
and those which lined the opposite side of the street.
There were no angels in the blue ether; but something
prompted him to take from his bosom a
piece of onyx enclosed in a casket of gold, and to
look at a sweet face cut into the stone.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she was anything like Elkiah's
daughter!"</p>

<p>He put the intaglio back into its pocket and
went away.</p>

<h2>III<br />

<span class="smaller">THE LITTLE BLIND SEER.</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> house of Elkiah was one of the most
stately in Jerusalem, though inferior to
the structure which, in more ancient
days, rose from the same foundations.
Whenever Elkiah told of his ancestral
dignities he was apt to show his listeners what
were now the cellars and sub-cellars of the house, the
great stones of which, by the flat indentations
chiselled about the borders, proved that they were as
old as the days when Solomon built the Temple, and
perhaps wrought by the same Ph&oelig;nician workmen.
The second story, and the battlements which enclosed
the roof, were of newer construction, and had
evidently been made of the débris of a former and
more palatial edifice, for an occasional huge and
broidered stone showed upon the street in ancient
architectural pride&mdash;just as some moderately circumstanced
people wear an occasional jewel left them by
their richer forebears.</p>

<p>The residence of Elkiah thus maintained a relation
to the other and ordinary houses of the city not
unlike that which its occupant held to his fellow-citizens.
He traced his blood to the days when another
Elkiah stood high in the court of Solomon,
and thence back to the settlement of the land by
the emigrants from Egypt. This could be attested
by the official records, and was illustrated by numer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>ous
priceless antiques now stored away in secret
closets cut into the solid walls, but which in safer
times had ornamented the house from battlement
to court.</p>

<p>For many years Elkiah had been the Nasi, or
President of the Sanhedrin, that combined ecclesiastical
and secular court of seventy-two men who
legislated for and judged the people. Of late years
the Sanhedrin itself had become utterly debauched
by the gold of Egyptian Ptolemies and Syrian Antiochuses,
in their rivalry for the possession of
Palestine. Most of the members of this sacred council
had become Hellenized, and adopted Greek philosophies
and customs; and now that the Syrian
monarch had invaded the city, these renegades saved
themselves from being despoiled by becoming despoilers
of their brethren. A former High Priest, Joshua,
had changed his name to the Greek Jason, as the
Greeks scornfully said, for the sake of the "Golden
Fleece." The present incumbent of the sacred office,
Menelaos, had been circumcised as Onias, and was
now the chief of the traitors in the sacrilegious extinction
of the national religion.</p>

<p>The crowning grief of the venerable Elkiah was
the apostasy of his own first-born son, Benjamin,
who had taken the heathen name of Glaucon, and
thus shamed the house of his fathers while he protected
it from the general pillage.</p>

<p>The late afternoon of the day following that of
Dion's rescue of Elkiah from the mob the old man
was reclining upon the thick rug and pillows which
Deborah&mdash;for so was his fair daughter called&mdash;had
spread upon the roof. Here he loved to lie, sheltered
from view by the parapets, while his eyes fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>lowed
the white clouds which flecked the deep blue
of the sky&mdash;"Jehovah's banners," he called them&mdash;or
caught the gleam of the Temple roof when he
was disposed to pray.</p>

<p>"Where is Caleb?" he asked.</p>

<p>A lad of some ten years was lying in the upper
chamber, the room which, like a little house by itself,
occupied half of the roof upon which it opened.
Hearing his father's call, the child sprang up, and
in an instant was by Elkiah's side.</p>

<p>"Here am I, father!"</p>

<p>With his long black hair clustering upon his white
chiton, and his large black eyes, the boy resembled
his sister. One would have noted, however, a
strange look; the pupils too widely expanded, as
when one tries to see in the dark. And this the
child had been doing ever since, five years ago, his
sight was destroyed by a strange malady which
not even the physician Samuel could cure, for all
that this learned man was skilled in the potencies
of herbs, the baleful and blessed beams of the stars,
and even the deeper mysteries of the words of the
Rabbis.</p>

<p>Little Caleb was marvellously beautiful in spite of
the stare of his blind eyes and the marble pallor of
his face. It was a child's face, yet there was in it
the placid sweetness of a woman's look, and at
times it seemed to glow with the intelligence of
riper years&mdash;for the boy had thought and felt more
than most men had done.</p>

<p>Caleb knelt down by his father's side, and kissed
his forehead. The old man's harsher features relaxed
at the touch of the young lips, and tears
sprang to his eyes as he drew the lad to his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blessed be God, who has left me this fair image
of my Miriam! Come, Caleb, and look for me.
Your blind eyes are better than mine, which my
sins have smitten. Can you see the chariots of the
Lord?"</p>

<p>"Nay, father, but you have taught me to trust in
Him who is Himself like 'the mountains round
about Jerusalem.' What need have we for chariots?
Can He not save by His word as well as by
war?"</p>

<p>"True, child! Yet I myself once saw, when the
impious Apollodorus raged through our street,
slaughtering all he met, and no one could stand
against him, I saw&mdash;or do I dream it?&mdash;I saw a
heavenly warrior, clad from head to foot in solid
silver, waving a sword of fire, who stood before
the wicked man, and smote him to the ground.
But when they lifted the heathen there was not the
sign of the stroke upon him, though he breathed
no more. Would that the Avenger might come
again, and speedily! But until He come&mdash;until He
come&mdash;we must trust the word, only the word.
Bring the Roll of the Prophet. It surely tells of the
times that are now passing."</p>

<p>The boy felt for his sister's hand. Taking it, he
pressed it against his blind eyes&mdash;a way he had of
checking his own too violent feeling. He whispered,
as he felt her comforting touch:</p>

<p>"Sister, the troubles have surely broken our father's
mind. He does not remember even yesterday."</p>

<p>Then, raising his voice, "You have forgotten, father,
that the soldiers came and searched the house
and took the Books away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Elkiah passed his hands over his forehead as if
to smooth the mirror of his memory. Recollection
came, but with it a rage that shook his decrepit
form until Deborah's kiss allayed his emotion.</p>

<p>"No matter for the Roll, father," said Caleb. "You
know that I can repeat what the Books say. Now
that I am blind, I keep in memory all that I hear.
In that way God lets me have more, perhaps, than
if I could see even to white Hermon there in the
north."</p>

<p>"Bless the eyes which the Spirit of the Lord has
opened!" cried the old man. "Tell me, child, what
says the Prophet of this monster who calls
himself our King&mdash;Epiphanes, the Glorious&mdash;for
shame!"</p>

<p>"The Prophet says," replied Caleb, quoting the
words of Daniel, "that his heart shall be against the
Holy Covenant, and they shall pollute the Sanctuary
of Strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice,
and shall place the Abomination that maketh desolate."</p>

<p>"Woe! Woe upon Jerusalem!" cried Elkiah. "Why
did I not slay the impious Apollonius, that child of
Satan, when he rode into our Holy of Holies? Alas!
the breath of the Lord has withered the arm of
Elkiah that it cannot smite. But the Avenger will
come. He will come yet. What says the Prophet
further, my son?"</p>

<p>Caleb continued, "And such as do wickedly against
the covenant shall be corrupt with flatteries."</p>

<p>"Ah!" groaned the old patriot, his voice gurgling
in his throat like the growl of a wild beast. "And
my own son, the son of Miriam, corrupted by the
flatteries of the Greek! My Benjamin turned into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Glaucon! God forgive me for having begotten a
traitor!"</p>

<p>Elkiah sat upright on the rug. With averted palm
he swept the air, as if he would banish from his
heart its paternal instinct. He then covered his face
with his hands and cried: "O my Miriam! I thank
Thee, O God, that Thou didst take her ere she knew
this. But, Lord, why didst Thou take my Miriam,
and leave me that&mdash;that&mdash;traitor? But read on,
child."</p>

<p>Waiting a moment until his father's paroxysm had
passed, Caleb completed the prediction: "But the
people that do know their God shall be strong, and
shall do exploits."</p>

<p>"Do exploits? Be strong? That we shall,"
shrieked the old man. "Your hand, Deborah! My
sword! I will go and smite the Syrian."</p>

<p>"Nay, father, that cannot be," said Deborah, as
she laid the exhausted form back upon the pillows.
"Let the children fulfil the Prophet's word."</p>

<p>"The children! My children!" muttered the old
man. "One of them a heathen, another blind, and
the other only a girl. Deborah, oh, that thou wert a
man, or could wear a sword like the Deborah of
old!"</p>

<p>Deborah summoned Ephraim, an old servant of the
house, who with Huldah his wife assisted in bringing
Elkiah into the roof chamber; for the air grew
cold as the sun dropped behind the citadel by the
Joppa gate, and left only his golden glow on the
top of Olivet eastward.</p>

<p>Little Caleb stood a while leaning over the parapet,
his face showing the tremendous movement of
his soul, now expressing some ineffable longing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
now hardening under some heroic purpose. He
turned toward the Temple as if he could see the
sacred precincts: but suddenly his great blind orbs
were directed southward. As his sister returned to
the roof he called to her.</p>

<p>"Deborah, there is a strange noise beyond the city
gate, over Ophel!"</p>

<p>"Dear child, you are not yet familiar with the
cries at the heathen games. The shouts come from
the gymnasium."</p>

<p>"Why, sister, I know all sounds. I know by the
dog's barking whether he has the fox on the run or
at bay, or has lost him in the hole. And men cry
just as the brutes do. I don't need to hear words.
I sometimes follow the games in the gymnasium
off there. Now it is the hum of the crowd before
the contests begin; now the cheer for the runners;
the laugh when the wrestlers tumble; the rage of the
losers; the joy of the crowd when a favorite wins&mdash;I
hear it all. But, Deborah, somebody has been
hurt over there. Can't you hear something sad in
the murmur on Ophel? It is as the fir-trees moan
when a storm is coming."</p>

<p>The sound which Caleb heard will be interpreted
if we tell of Captain Dion's doings that day.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DISCUS THROW.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> high plateau of Ophel swells out
from the southern wall of the Temple,
and looks down upon the vales of Hinnom
and Kedron, which come together
at its base, five hundred feet below.
From this promontory one can see for miles through
the deep valley, which is lined near the city with
rock-hewn tombs, and in the distance with whitish-gray
cliffs, as if the Kedron had become a leper
outcast from the company of the beautiful hills and
vales which elsewhere surround Jerusalem. Down,
down the valley it goes until lost to sight amid the
mountains of stone and sand that make the wilderness
of Judea. There the leper dies and is buried in
the Dead Sea. Whichever way lies the wind, except
from the north, it sweeps this promontory of Ophel
with refreshing coolness. Here in the olden time the
sages and saints of Israel had been accustomed to
walk, their meditations on the judgments of God
perhaps more sombre because of the gloomy grandeur
of the scene; and here the multitudes had
thronged, with hearts gladdened by the contrast of
joy of their city with the distant desolation.</p>

<p>But now, by the orders of Apollonius, the Governor
under Antiochus, the top of Ophel had been
levelled for the stately building of the gymnasium.</p>

<p>To one looking up from the valley of the Kedron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the graceful Greek porticos must have showed
against the old gray walls of the Temple like vines
on the scarp of a mountain boulder. In front of the
structure lay the athletic field, dotted with many
colored pennants which denoted the places reserved
for the various games. At one end of the field was
the stadium, the running track, some six hundred
feet in length. Adjoining this was an open court in
which were practised wrestling, throwing the discus,
swinging the great hanging stone, hurling the javelin,
archery, sword play, boxing, and the like. By
the side of this court were baths, and near them
great caldrons supplying the luxury of heated water.</p>

<p>In shaded porches were raised platforms upon
which at stated hours rhetoricians who plumed
themselves upon their eloquence discoursed of philosophy
and poetry and love. Here, too, professors of
the calisthenic art exhibited in their own persons
and those of their pupils the graces of the human
form.</p>

<p>Captain Dion emerged from the Street of the
Cheesemakers upon the athletic field. He saluted
the banner of Apollonius, which flaunted from its
tall staff, then cast a spray of ivy at the foot of the
statue of Hermes, the god of the race. He was at
once hailed by a group of young men with whom
he was evidently a favorite.</p>

<p>Among these was Glaucon. A broad-brimmed hat
topped his head. Artificially curled black locks
stuccoed his brow. A white chlamys, or outer robe,
of linen broadly bordered with purple was draped
from his shoulder in the latest style of the capital.</p>

<p>"Ah, Glaucon, well met! How has it fared with
you since we parted at Joppa?" was Dion's greeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
"Has the sea jog gotten out of your legs yet? If the
mountains of Carmel and Cassius on the coast had
been turned to water the waves could not have
tossed us more than when we came from Antioch."</p>

<p>"Jerusalem is a poor exchange for Antioch," replied
Glaucon. "One day at Daphne for a lifetime
here, but for a few good fellows like you, Captain."</p>

<p>"Did you succeed in getting the order for confiscation
reversed?" asked the Greek.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I shall hold the property; that is, if I
can keep the old man, my father, within doors, so
that he doesn't bring a mob about our ears as he did
yesterday. Apollonius&mdash;Pluto take him!&mdash;mulcted
me heavily of shekels last night as a guarantee that
the old bigot would keep the peace. I wish that
you would give the Governor a fair word for me,
Dion. You see, I have not come into the estate yet,
and haven't many gold feathers to drop. Apollonius
seems to think that I am moulting all my
ancestral wealth."</p>

<p>"I think I can get the Governor to at least pare
your nails without cutting the quick hereafter," replied
his friend.</p>

<p>"My thanks. I shall need your help, Captain, in
all ways, for though I have donned the King's
livery, you Greeks look on me as a Jew. I am like
to fall between the upper and nether millstones.
My people have cast me off, and, by Hercules! yours
do not take to me as they should."</p>

<p>"Never fear, Glaucon," replied Dion. "A man who
can swear 'By Hercules!' instead of 'As the Lord
liveth!' will soon have the favor of our gods."</p>

<p>"And goddesses, too, I hope," laughed Glaucon.
"But I have not thanked you, Dion, for saving my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
father from his crazy venture on the streets yesterday.
The shade of Anchises bless you for that!"</p>

<p>"Well up in the poets, too, I see," said the Captain,
slapping his comrade on the back. "Your
brain is Greek if your blood be Hebrew. But let us
hear what this blabber is saying."</p>

<p>The men stood a moment listening to an orator
who, with well-oiled locks and classically arranged
toga, was addressing a small group within a portico.
He was just saying: "Hear then the words of
the divine Plato, 'When a beautiful soul harmonizes
with a beautiful body, and the two are cast into the
same mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him
that has an eye to contemplate the vision.' Truly
the soul is made fair by the fairness of the body.
Thought glows when the eye sparkles. Heroism is
bred of conscious strength of muscle. Love burns
within the arms of beauty, and with the kisses
scented with the sweet breath of health. Think you
that the gods would dwell within the statues if the
sculptors did not shape the marble and ivory to
exquisite proportions?</p>

<p>"Behold, then, the stupidity of these Jews whose
foul nests we are destroying. They read their Rolls,
but they gain no wisdom. They pray, yet remain
impious. It is because they know not the first of
maxims, namely, that the body is the matrix of the
mind."</p>

<p>"The fool!" was Dion's comment. "There are better
declaimers in any Greek village. And"&mdash;more to
himself than to his comrade, as a band of Jews,
among them even some renegade priests, stripped
naked, ran by them on their way to the racing
stadium&mdash;"yet see, there are bigger fools!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>When the two men passed into the gymnasium
proper, the crowd on the benches raised the cry of
"Dion! Dion!" until the crossbeam shook down its
dust of applause.</p>

<p>The Captain gracefully acknowledged the compliment
by taking from his brow the chaplet, now well
withered, and flinging it from him into the crowd
with the exclamation: "I will win it again before I
wear it."</p>

<p>The magnanimous challenge brought the champion
another ovation.</p>

<p>The chief gymnasiarch approached, and read from
his tablets the names of the day's victors in the
various contests that had already taken place. He
bade Dion select an antagonist from the list.</p>

<p>"I will throw the discus," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"Then your competitor will be Yusef, the Lebanon
giant," read the gymnasiarch. He shouted:</p>

<p>"Hear ye! Yusef of Damascus is challenged by
Dion of Philippi."</p>

<p>Divesting himself of his garment the Greek now
stood naked among his compeers.</p>

<p>"Adonis has descended," shouted one, in a tone
that might have been taken for either admiration
or contempt.</p>

<p>An alipta came and rubbed Dion's arms and back
with oil mingled with dust.</p>

<p>"Better rub him against the Jew. He'll get both
grease and dirt at a touch," sneered some one.</p>

<p>Dion turned, and, fronting the group whence the
insult came, scanned the faces one by one; but there
was no response to his mute challenge.</p>

<p>As he moved away one ventured to say, loud
enough to be heard by a few about him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Jewish renegade is protected by special order
of the King, or, by the club of Herakles! I would
grind his face with my fists."</p>

<p>"The Captain seems to be the pimp's special body-guard
just now," was a reply; after which the knot
of men talked in low tones among themselves, casting
furtive glances in the direction of Dion.</p>

<p>"Yusef stands on his record of this morning,"
shouted the gymnasiarch. "He need not throw
again unless Dion shall pass him."</p>

<p>The Greek balanced in his hand two circular
pieces of bronze, in order to select one of them.
The crowd densely lined the way the missile was to
fly. There was eager rivalry for places at the goal
end, where the friends of the contestants craned their
necks to see the exact spot the discus would strike,
ready to applaud or dispute it. In this group
Glaucon had secured a foremost stand, and waited,
leaning with the crowd.</p>

<p>"Here's your chance to stick the pig of a Jew,"
whispered one to his neighbor, who stood just behind
Glaucon.</p>

<p>Dion held the bright bronze in his right hand, his
fingers grasping tightly the outer rim, while the
weight fell upon his open palm and wrist. Raising
his left arm the more perfectly to balance his weight,
he pivoted himself upon his left foot, then, swinging
the discus backward in almost a complete circle,
and combining the muscles of arm and trunk and
leg in one tremendous return motion, he flung the
metal gleaming through the air.</p>

<p>At the same instant Glaucon was thrust by those
behind him headlong into the path of the flying
missile. The swift swirl of the disc together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
its weight made its impact as dangerous as that of
a sword blade. It struck the falling form of Glaucon,
terribly bruising the base of his head, and laying
open a ghastly wound in his neck and shoulder.</p>

<p>Dion strode down the line. He glanced an instant
at the prostrate form of his friend, turned as quickly
as a bear, seized two of the throng of bystanders,
dashed their heads together until they were half-stunned,
then flung them sprawling apart. They lay
moaning and cursing on the ground amid the derisions
of the crowd until the gymnasiarch ordered
them under arrest.</p>

<p>The gymnastæ, or surgeons of the field of sports,
were summoned; but the case of Glaucon was beyond
the present need of their splints and unguents.</p>

<p>Dion bade them carry the apparently lifeless form
to Elkiah's house, and himself led the way. It was
this sad company which the clairvoyant mind of the
blind boy detected before the searching gaze of
Deborah saw the approaching litter.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is Benjamin! Benjamin is hurt!"
cried Caleb, leaning an instant over the
parapet. While Deborah was looking
into the street he felt his way to the
steps leading down from the roof
into the open court around which the house was
built. He darted across this as quickly and silently
as a flash from the brass mirror, not even
waking Ephraim, the servant, who had fallen
asleep watching the ripples in the great basin of the
fountain that stood in the centre of the court. In another
instant the boy had raised the crossbar from
the lintels and was hasting down the narrow street.
Extending his hands he guided himself through the
crowds, keeping always in the centre of the way as
infallibly as a stick floats in the middle of a wild
rushing torrent. In vain did Deborah, as she saw
him, call him from the parapet. She flew down the
stone stairway and out into the street.</p>

<p>"What haste, my black-eyed beauty?" said an impudent
soldier, blocking her way.</p>

<p>By a quick movement Deborah eluded him, but
only to be stopped scarcely twenty paces beyond by
another, who stretched out his arms and seized her
by the wrists. She stood as if paralyzed by her
wrath at this indignity, for never before had a rude
hand touched her; then, with sudden agility and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
strength which seemed beyond a woman's, she
wrenched herself from her captor. Taking time and
breath for one indignant cry, "You coward!" she
ran on, while the crowd was temporarily diverted
by their jeers at the discomfited soldier.</p>

<p>"The eunuchs are stronger than you, man, for they
can keep the women from running away from the
harems."</p>

<p>"Her fire-eyes burnt out your heart, did they?
Open your corselet, and let's see if it be charred."</p>

<p>Deborah turned into the Cheesemakers Street.
Here she met a company of officers.</p>

<p>"Catch the gazelle! She is my spoil!" shouted the
leader.</p>

<p>Her arms were instantly seized from behind.</p>

<p>"Apollonius has captured the very Daughter of
Jerusalem that the Jews talk about," remarked
one.</p>

<p>"Apollonius?" cried Deborah, looking at one whose
gorgeous plumage indicated that he was the chief
officer.</p>

<p>He was a man of prepossessing appearance. His
brow was broad, features finely proportioned; a
man evidently trained to think and govern. In
younger days he must have been exceedingly handsome,
but middle life showed the effects of dissipation.
A furtive flicker in his eyes belied his assumption
of self-command. His lips were swollen from
too frequent communion with the spirit of the vine.</p>

<p>"Apollonius!" cried Deborah. "Does Apollonius
dare to break his own orders? Is it true, then, as
men say, that there is neither honor nor mercy in
a Syrian?" fixing her gaze unflinchingly upon the
Governor's face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! and who is my charmer? Beautiful as a
leopard at bay, or Aphrodite herself is a hag. Come,
can you leap as high as my arms?" said the Governor,
amid the laughter of his attendants.</p>

<p>"I am the daughter of Elkiah," said Deborah,
"whose house you have given your sworn word to
spare, if you be indeed General Apollonius."</p>

<p>"By all the nymphs this side of Olympus! I am
sorry to hear it," replied he. "If I had known that
the old bigot had so fair a daughter, I would have
qualified my order. But let her pass, my men. We
must keep our word, of course."</p>

<p>A counter commotion was heard down the street.</p>

<p>"Way for the litter! Way for the litter!" shouted
those coming.</p>

<p>With a sharp outcry, Deborah darted from the
soldiers about her and ran to the side of the wounded
man.</p>

<p>"It is Benjamin!" she exclaimed, throwing her
arms about the insensible form which the bearers
had for the moment put down. "Speak to me, my
brother!"</p>

<p>The girl's grief at first seemed inconsolable. But
suddenly she was transformed into a Fury. She
stood straight but trembling, with hands clenched,
and glared upon the bystanders. For a little her
passion prevented speech. Then she broke forth,
with tone and gesture and look which fitted her
words:</p>

<p>"A curse upon his murderer! Who struck this
cowardly blow?"</p>

<p>She raised her hand as if to smite any one who
dared confess the deed.</p>

<p>"It was but an accident, fair daughter of Elkiah,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
responded Dion, with a manner that disarmed her
rage. "Your brother is not dead. See, he lives."</p>

<p>He bent over his friend with evident joy as the
Jew opened his eyes and gazed, at first with stupidity
and then curiously, at the Greek and his sister.
The glance at Dion was with the flicker of a
smile; that upon his sister brought an expression
of pain. The next moment he put his hand to his
head, and, uttering a sharp cry, lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Deborah and Dion stood one on either side of the
litter. Their hands touched as they stroked the forehead
of the sufferer. They looked into each other's
faces. With her it was only the recognition of a
common sympathy.</p>

<p>But Dion had other thoughts. The vision of the
face he had seen at Elkiah's doorway had not faded
for an instant from his imagination. Now his impression
of her beauty was reinforced by the revelation
of her soul. What courage! what audacity!
yet not beyond a woman's right! Had he struck
a wilful blow at Glaucon, he thought that her wrath
would have killed him, so just would it have been,
and so imperious was her voice and action. Yet
what love this woman was capable of! She seemed
to him like some goddess weeping at her own altar
which had been despoiled; for surely Glaucon was
not worthy of this outpouring of her affection. Dion
thought that he knew women. To him the most
were but as stagnant pools, with surface glistening
in the sunlight, while the depths&mdash;if there were
any&mdash;were soiled. But he imagined that this woman's
soul was transparent, limpid, and infinitely
deep; pouring itself out spontaneously, with as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
little self-consciousness as that of a fountain when
it throws aloft its white spray.</p>

<p>Yet he had injured this woman&mdash;unintentionally,
it was true; but his hand had thrown the fatal
disc which cut its way into her soul, as really as
into the flesh of her brother. How could he atone
for this?</p>

<p>There came also to Dion a deeper anxiety. Glaucon
would recover; but what of this girl's coming
life? A Jewish maiden left alone amid the license
of Antiochus' soldiers! A dove in the serpent's nest
would be as safe. Glaucon could not protect her.
With Elkiah's death the renegade son would&mdash;as
he had heard frequently in the camp&mdash;quickly "be
cashed," and another estate rattle as coin in Apollonius'
belt. Then what of this girl? Dion felt as
if a hand from the sky was ordaining him her protector.
Yet what power had he?</p>

<p>Upon hearing the commotion about the litter
Apollonius turned back. As if to redeem his repute
for the dastardly insult of a few moments before,
he now made most respectful salaam to the young
woman, and, with the semblance of kindly solicitude
for Glaucon, gave orders detailing Captain Dion to
act as guard for the wounded man. Thus, having
assumed by his manner the credit for what Dion had
already done, he rejoined his suite.</p>

<p>The men were about to lift the litter when Deborah
startled them with the cry:</p>

<p>"But Caleb! Where is the blind boy? Surely he
came this way."</p>

<p>"We have seen none such. He must have passed
by another street. Doubtless he has gone home,"
was the Greek's response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I must find him!"</p>

<p>There was a maternal depth in the girl's tones.</p>

<p>"Where could he have gone? Help me, good sir,
and the blessing of the Lord will be upon you."</p>

<p>"We could not find him in these streets," said
Dion. "Let us go first to your home. If he is not
there we will search elsewhere. And I think that
my name will open any place where he may be detained."</p>

<p>"Quick, then; let us haste!"</p>

<p>The girl in her eagerness led the way. Reaching
the house, she opened the outer door, which had not
been fastened after her exit a little while before, and
sped across the open court. Elkiah was calling.</p>

<p>"Here am I, father!" and in an instant more she
was beside him on the roof.</p>

<p>"My daughter, where have you been? Have the
Gentiles bewitched even my Deborah, that she should
go out of doors to gaze at them? Nay, veil your
face with shame, child. Henceforth you must abide
strictly in the house. It may be our sepulchre, but
I would rather my daughter died here, than that the
same sun should greet her eyes and theirs, except that
she hated them. But for a daughter of Jerusalem to
so much as look upon their garments is to play the
wanton."</p>

<p>"Speak not such words, my father," cried Deborah,
kneeling by his side, and placing his hands upon her
forehead in claiming his blessing.</p>

<p>"It is Benjamin, father. They have brought him
back to us, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Benjamin!" cried the old man, his voice failing in
utterance until it became almost a hiss. "Benjamin!
I have no son Benjamin. He has disowned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
name; I disown his blood. What does the traitor
Glaucon do in the house of Elkiah? Let him be
gone! I charge thee, Deborah, if thou be a true
daughter, banish him from our house."</p>

<p>"But, father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, let him be gone!"</p>

<p>"But, father, Benjamin is harmed; wounded; it
may be he is killed."</p>

<p>The venerable man raised himself on his arm, and
stared about him. Deborah laid him gently back
upon the pillows.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, do not curse him. It may be he will
not live. Do not curse him."</p>

<p>He gazed at her, taking her face between his hands
and drawing it close to his.</p>

<p>"Aye, my Miriam again! Would God, Deborah,
you had been my son!"</p>

<p>"But, father, pity our Benjamin. He is grievously
hurt."</p>

<p>A change passed over the features of Elkiah. Suddenly
the tears dimmed his sight, and he said:</p>

<p>"Benjamin hurt? My boy? The child of Miriam
harmed? Where is he? Help me, that I may go to
him."</p>

<p>He vainly tried to rise. His hands clenched as he
muttered:</p>

<p>"The Lord avenge the house of Elkiah upon the
heads of the heathen! The Lord spare my child!
Benjamin! Benjamin! Would God I had died for
thee!"</p>

<p>When she had seen the wounded man brought
safely into the lower chamber, Deborah quickly
searched every part of the house, and her cry for
Caleb rang from the roof to the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is not here. I will go again to the street."</p>

<p>The strong, but kind, hand of Dion blocked the
way: "Nay, good maiden, you cannot return to the
city. I will go where you could not. I swear to
search the streets and camps if you will but pledge
me to abide here."</p>

<p>"A pledge to a Greek!"</p>

<p>But the look of scorn passed quickly from her
face, as she saw the solicitude in his. After a little
thought, in which her agitated manner told that she
could keep such a promise only with her body, and
that her whole soul would go with Dion in his
search, she replied:</p>

<p>"It is well. I see it is my duty to stay here, sir.
But hasten! Hasten, and I will pray for you every
step. The Lord bless you, good sir!"</p>

<p>"Your own blessing were enough," said Dion, as
he ran down the steps.</p>

<h2>VI<br />

<span class="smaller">A JEWISH CUPID</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-d.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Dion</span> knew that a personal search for the
lad among the crowds of soldiers, who
were lodged in half the houses of the
city, and in hundreds of tents beyond
the walls, would be a long, if not a
useless one, since, if any persons had captured the
child, they would have reason for concealing his
whereabouts. Dion went, therefore, at once to the
headquarters of Apollonius, that he might obtain
an order that none would dare disregard.</p>

<p>The house appropriated to the Governor's use was
the palace on Mount Sion. Though the finest residential
structure in Jerusalem, like Elkiah's house, it
was but a sorry scion of its architectural pedigree.
For instead of the colonnades where Solomon once
walked, and the golden roof which had sheltered the
harem of that pious libertine, where now the lime
whitened walls and domes of what, but for its site,
might have been taken for a caravansery.</p>

<p>Captain Dion passed through the court, with its
broken ancient fountains and cheap reproductions
of recent Greek statuary. He was greeted by Apollonius
at the entrance to the hall of audience.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Dion! In time to sup with me to-night.
After the feast we will have a symposium
that will make the dead Alexander come to life with
envy. He would risk another death by fever for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
sake of a draught of such wines as the King has
sent me from Antioch."</p>

<p>Dion excused himself, and stated the purpose of
his visit.</p>

<p>"Nay; so jovial and witty a comrade as yourself
cannot be let off," cried the roystering commandant.
"Nor need you trouble yourself about the boy.
I will issue the order that he be brought here. It
will be a quicker way and more certain&mdash;that is, if
the circumcised dog be living, which we may doubt;
for, since the permission given yesterday, the men
are making short work of all this Jewish spawn."</p>

<p>Dion changed his tack, and urged that he must
return to take care of his friend Glaucon.</p>

<p>"What care you for the traitor Glaucon?" replied
the General. "If that man betrays his own race
he will not be true to you. It is enough that such
creatures as Glaucon are allowed to live, and keep
their property, which should be our common spoil.
Let him die of his hurt; we shall all be the better
off, with one Jew less and houses more. But stay
you shall, Dion, or, by Herakles! I will issue orders
to cut the boy's throat when found. No carouse is
complete if Dion be absent," he said, throwing his
arm about him. "Come now, it's a treaty with
you. I know that your friendship is not for Glaucon,
but for the black-eyed Diana, his sister, whom
I saw to-day. Drink with us you shall, or I shall
be jealous as Zeus is of his Hera, and send your
Jewish goddess straight to Antiochus as a gift.
Go, then, get your ivy and head-grease, and come
back quickly; for see, the gnomon already casts
shadow of six paces&mdash;the hour the gods themselves
have set for supper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I must eat your dainty meats," said Dion,
seeing the futility of opposing the distempered will
of his superior. Veiling his resentment under a forced
hilarity, he retired, and a half-hour later returned
in company with the other guests.</p>

<p>These were high officers in gorgeous togas, and
caps whose tasselled tops lapped down to their
shoulders. Each of these revellers was accompanied
to the palace by one or more slaves, who would
wait upon their masters at the feast, and take
them home when drunk. A few subalterns were invited
who, like Dion, compensated for lack of rank
by their ready wit and their repertoire of stories
and songs.</p>

<p>As the guests reclined upon the cushions their
shoes were unlaced and removed by Apollonius'
menials, their feet washed in scented water, and
gently rubbed with towels, while their caps were
displaced by crowns of bay leaves gemmed with the
pearly berries. Then the low tables were drawn
within reach, laden with all that the distant markets
of Antioch could furnish; for the conquered land
of Judea gave them not so much as a fig or date.
The Jews had left for the invaders only fish and
game; but woe to the Syrian soldier who should
venture beyond his camps to drop a line in lake or
send an arrow after beast or bird!</p>

<p>The viands were quickly disposed of, for, following
the Greek custom, no wine was poured until the meats
and spicy condiments had created abundant thirst.</p>

<p>"A soldier's hunger is soon satisfied, but his thirst
is like the river Oceanus that runs round the earth
and has no end," cried Apollonius. "Let's to the
potation. Who shall be master of the feast?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dion! Dion!" was shouted, with clapping and
cheers.</p>

<p>Apollonius whispered to his next neighbor:</p>

<p>"The master of the feast, according to custom,
must remain sober. We must have Dion's tongue
loosened with wine, or we shall not skim the cream
of his wit. Call for Kallisthenes. He is duller drunk
than sober."</p>

<p>"Kallisthenes! Kallisthenes!" went round the
table, as the suggestion of the host was whispered
from one to another.</p>

<p>"This is a deserved honor," shouted Apollonius,
"for the man who fired the gates of the Jews' Temple."</p>

<p>"Aye, it was a valiant deed, for there wasn't so
much as a lame Jew to stop him," said Sotades
to Dion, who reclined next to him.</p>

<p>"If Apollonius is scattering heroic honors to-night,
he should send for the High Priest, Menelaos, for
he stole the golden candlesticks from the Holy Place
before we could get hold of them," said another.</p>

<p>"Menelaos! The Jew turned Greek! Dion says
he once frightened an Ethiopian into a white man.
So Menelaos became a Greek. That Jew's lips would
poison the wine. Let him get ready for his feast
with the worms of Gehenna," grunted the Governor.</p>

<p>Kallisthenes at once assumed the prerogative of
Ruler of the Feast. He put on a chaplet of ivy, and
proclaimed the laws for the hour.</p>

<p>"Hear ye, my subjects, the rules of the feast, which
all shall obey under penalty of the wrath of the
gods. May Bacchus and Aphrodite both desert the
wretch who fails in his duty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Law the first&mdash;The wine shall not be mixed with
more than half water."</p>

<p>"What goblets shall we use?" asked one. "If the
larger ones, I vote for one part wine to three parts
water, as Hesiod recommends."</p>

<p>"A frog's drink, as Pharecrates called it," replied
the Ruler. "Half and half it shall be, and he who
shirks the large goblet shall drink from the crater
itself. Are we not all philosophers? And did not
Socrates drink from the wine cooler?"</p>

<p>"Agreed! Agreed!" echoed round the circle.</p>

<p>One ruddy-faced veteran knelt in mock adoration
at the feet of the Feast Master:</p>

<p>"I humbly crave that, since I was born in distant
Phrygia, we to-night follow the custom of the barbarians,
and drink no water at all. Let us be
inspired with the unadulterated soul of the
god."</p>

<p>"Bacchus pardon thy gluttony for the sake of thy
piety," said the Master.</p>

<p>"Law the second&mdash;Whereas wine should be drunk
either hot or cold, and whereas, these Jews who are
still above Hades have stopped the way to the
mountains where lies the snow to chill it, therefore
it is ordained that all drinks shall be heated with
both fire and spice."</p>

<p>"Agreed! Agreed!"</p>

<p>"Law the third&mdash;Every goblet shall be quaffed
from brim to bottom between two breaths."</p>

<p>"It is agreed!"</p>

<p>"Oh! my paunch!" cried one. "Do you think me
a Deucalion to stand the deluge?"</p>

<p>Servants poured the water and wine in equal
quantities into the crater, or great bowl, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
which it was ladled into the large goblets, holding
half a quart each.</p>

<p>"A bumper first to Bacchus."</p>

<p>It was drunk with avidity. One started a song
from the old poet Anacreon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">"Thirsty earth drinks up the rain,</div>
       <div class="verse">Trees from earth drink that again,</div>
       <div class="verse">Ocean drinks the air, the sun</div>
       <div class="verse">Drinks the sea, and him the moon.</div>
       <div class="verse">Any reason canst thou think</div>
       <div class="verse">I should thirst while all these drink?"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Eros follows Bacchus," cried the Feast Master.
"Now a cup to the Syrian goddess Astarte, since
we are in her land, or to Aphrodite, Venus, or
whatever name each one calls his lady-love."</p>

<p>"Aye, a cup to Bathsheba! if any one has found
a Jewess to his taste," shouted Apollonius, lifting
his goblet toward Dion.</p>

<p>Songs and comic speeches, extemporized pantomimes,
riddles and stories, as the wine happened to
stir the peculiar talent or caprice of the guest, interspersed
the drinking.</p>

<p>As the hours advanced the curtains at the doorway
were swung aside, and a troop of dancing girls
entered. They were of various races; the fair Caucasian
from the Euxine, the Egyptian whose hue
was the reflection of her desert sands, swarthy half-black
Arabs from beyond Jordan, and Nubians
whose faces seemed cut from solid jet&mdash;slaves whom
Apollonius had captured or exchanged for other
spoil of battle. These rendered the various songs
and dances of their native lands. One performed the
hazardous exploit of stepping to the throbbing of
the zither between a score of sword blades, set with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
points upward. Another honored Apollonius by
advancing on her hands, seizing the ladle of the
wine jar between her toes, and dexterously filling
with its contents the empty cup of the commandant.</p>

<p>"Let Apollonius, the valiant conqueror of Jerusalem,
show us a daughter of Israel. He is making a
harem of them, if report be true," cried one.</p>

<p>"Jewish maidens will not dance on anything except
the thin air. So we had to hang a score of
them yesterday," replied Apollonius. "But I will
show you a genuine Jewish Cupid."</p>

<p>"A circumcised Cupid! Apollonius' wit is as sharp
as his knife," cried Kallisthenes.</p>

<p>The Governor whispered to an attendant. In a
few moments there was thrust into the room a
naked boy. His limbs were exquisitely moulded.
His large distended pupils shone with strange lustre
in the flashing lights of the jewelled lanterns. His
outstretched hands and cautious step showed that
there was no sight in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo! Cupid is blind! Well thought,
Apollonius! Let us see to whom he has brought a
message from the goddess," said Sotades.</p>

<p>At this moment Kallisthenes uttered a cry of surprise
and horror. He leaped to his feet and pointed
to the great bowl from which the wine was
taken.</p>

<p>The servant, whose attention had been unduly
drawn to the revellers, had inadvertently laid the
ladle across the brim of the crater,&mdash;a thing regarded
as ominous of dire calamity to some one of the
guests, the evil to be averted only by the instant
cessation of the revelry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The feasters looked, and echoed the consternation
of the Feast Master.</p>

<p>The guests unceremoniously rose, and were hastening
as fast as their uncertain legs and frightened
attendants could carry them, when Apollonius recalled
them. "A curse on the slave! Let us appease
our Nemesis of the feast with the offal of the villain
who has broken its rules!" and lifting the crater he
felled the unfortunate man who had perpetrated the
dire omen.</p>

<p>As the guests, half sobered by the scene, stood
about the prostrate body Apollonius said:</p>

<p>"Hear you, good friends, to-morrow we will treat
you to something more ominous still. We will offer
another sacrifice,&mdash;a sow upon the Jews' altar in the
Temple, court. Attend me there. Farewell! Bacchus
protect his own!"</p>

<p>Dion took the hand of Apollonius.</p>

<p>"My thanks, General, for your aid in recovering
this child, whom I will return to his home."</p>

<p>The Governor lowered his voice:</p>

<p>"Serve me as well when occasion requires, Captain
Dion; and if Elkiah's daughter does not reward your
service with her favor, tell her what she owes to
Apollonius, and I will cast my bait."</p>

<p>The revellers dispersed to their various quarters,
some to the citadel, some to the camps outside the
walls, and some to the mansions from which they
had ejected the owners. One or two of the slaves
lighted torches of resinous wood to guide the feet of
their masters along the stones, which were slippery
with the sewage thrown from the doorways, or
poured over the roof parapets into the street. But
most of the servants were fully occupied in sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>porting
the limp bodies of their lords, and now and
then lifting them out of the holes where, once fallen,
they insisted upon sitting, while they called for more
wine, or relieved themselves of what they had already
taken.</p>

<h2>VII<br />

<span class="smaller">IN THE TOILS OF APOLLONIUS</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-d.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Dion</span> hastened toward the house of Elkiah,
leading the blind child by the
hand. As they threaded their way
through the narrow streets, Caleb told
his story of the day's adventures. He
had been seized in the afternoon, and taken somewhere
beyond the walls, among the soldiers in the
tents. He overheard his captors talking of the reward
that Elkiah would give for the return of his
son, and intimating how much more they could
wring from Glaucon, when some one claimed him in
the name of Apollonius. He was led away, as he
supposed, to be killed, and was surprised at being
conducted to the palace.</p>

<p>Dion plied him with questions, but could elicit no
further information. The Captain knew Apollonius
too well to believe that the introduction of a Jewish
Cupid at the feast, and the rescue of the lad,
were all there was to his purpose. He pondered the
problem in the light of the Governor's well-known
selfishness and sensuality. Did his design reach to
the possession of Deborah?</p>

<p>Coming to the house of Elkiah they were surprised
to find the outer door unfastened. Caleb ran up the
stairs and heralded his coming with many shouts.</p>

<p>Elkiah was sitting beside the wounded Benjamin
in the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Lord be praised! His mercy endureth forever!"
ejaculated the father as Caleb flung himself
into his arms.</p>

<p>"But where is Deborah?" cried the lad.</p>

<p>"Is not your sister with you? Then how came
you hither, child?" replied the old man, in that quick
terror to which the events of recent days had made
him susceptible.</p>

<p>"I brought him here, sir. I, Dion."</p>

<p>"Met you not my daughter? You sent for her?
No? I understand it not. One came bringing as a
token a bit of the lad's clothing, and pledged to
take her where the lost might be found. I thought
the messenger had come from you. Ere I could detain
her, Deborah was gone. Was it not you that
sent? May I believe a Greek? Trifle not, I beseech
you, with one whose life-thread can endure but little
more. My daughter! O give me my daughter! If
harm has come to her through thee, the curse of
the Lord rot thy bones! O my child! My child!"</p>

<p>"It is the trick of the soldiers. They thought to
get Deborah too," cried Caleb.</p>

<p>"Alas," said Dion, "that you were not blind, and
could see to take me to the place where they kept
you before the General sent for you."</p>

<p>"That I can do," said the boy. "I saw all the
way."</p>

<p>"Saw?"</p>

<p>"Aye, with my feet and with my nostrils and with
my ears, I saw everything. Outside the walls we
went down, down, down; it must have been to cross
the Kedron. Then we went up, up, up, fully halfway
the ascent toward Bethany. We went close to
a cactus hedge, for I felt on my cheeks the cool air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the cactus breathes. Then over a broken wall, for I
fell among the stones. Next a house, high and of
smooth mortar walls, for I can tell such things by
the echo one's footfall makes. The tent we stopped
at was near where horses, as many as threescore,
were tethered; this I knew from their neighing. It
is an old camp, for the odor of the dung was old."</p>

<p>"I have the spot," said Dion. "It is the camp of
Cleanthes. Let me away! But Glaucon, your Benjamin,
does well?" bending a moment over the sleeping
form.</p>

<p>"So said the surgeon you brought," replied Elkiah.
"But haste! O God of Abraham, take my
son if Thou wilt, but spare, oh, spare, my Deborah!
God be merciful! Thy billows are gone over me.
Spare me that I may see again the face of my
child, and gather strength before I go hence, and be
no more!"</p>

<p>Caleb's judgment that Deborah had been decoyed
by the soldiers proved true. Her guide led her to
the palace of Apollonius. On the way she passed the
roysterers returning from the banquet. The presence
of the soldier did not shield her from the insult
of their tongues so well as did her preoccupation
with anxiety for her brother. She was left alone in
the antechamber of the Governor. Now and then
she inquired in vain of the passing servants for the
blind child. Growing suspicious, she endeavored to
make her escape, but found the exits fastened, as she
tried them one by one.</p>

<p>At length the Governor came to her. He was
flushed and unsteady from the effects of his debauch,
and accosted her with maudlin insolence.</p>

<p>"Ah, my pretty Jewess!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I came, sir, to claim the blind child, son of
Elkiah."</p>

<p>"But suppose I should first claim the daughter of
Elkiah. On the street I let you go, but since you
have come to me, well&mdash;that is different. My will
must rule in my own palace."</p>

<p>"Aye, the will of Apollonius, who has given his
word for the safety of the house of Elkiah," replied
the girl undaunted.</p>

<p>"True, my fair one, and Apollonius will keep his
word. You are in danger anywhere else than here.
None are safe in Jerusalem but those who come beneath
my shadow. To-morrow the soldiers will be
let loose. I cannot hold them back any longer.
Elkiah's house may go with the rest of the damned
Jews. Apollonius' friendship is better than the
sword of his soldiers, eh, is it not?"</p>

<p>He put out his hands.</p>

<p>This terrible threat and the hideous alternative it
presented to her were too much for the girl to take
in at once. She sank at the monster's feet.</p>

<p>"Ah, my sweet one, don't do that. No slave shall
you be to me; but I will give you as many jewels
as&mdash;as the fair Clarissa, the Queen of the Grove of
Daphne, wears. And I swear by your bright eyes,
you shall outshine the very goddesses of Antiochus'
palace."</p>

<p>He stooped and touched her. Then she quivered
as if stung by a scorpion.</p>

<p>"Mercy, sir! Mercy for the house of Elkiah! An
old man, a blind child, a wretched girl,&mdash;these are
not enemies for the great Apollonius to crush.
Brave men would despise him for harming such."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted the Governor, "and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
would despise me more for letting such a splendid
woman as you go to another,&mdash;even to Dion."</p>

<p>At this word Deborah leaped to her feet.</p>

<p>Apollonius held out his arms to her, but recoiled
as he saw her whole frame the impersonation of
hatred and rage. He would as soon have ventured
to grasp a sheet of flame. Then his face hardened.
Fixing upon her a pair of cold, steely eyes, he assumed
the pose of a bargainer. Had each word been
a knife-cut severing a piece of her flesh for the
weighing scale, he could not have more cruelly
tortured her.</p>

<p>"I have heard that the daughters of Jewry are of
such filial devotion that they will give their lives
for their sires. Will this one not give Apollonius her
friendship for her father's life?"</p>

<p>Deborah stood like a statue. The flush faded
from her face as if her soul had fled. She forgot for
the moment the scene and the man before her. She
was with her father. She saw his face so white,
with blood on his beard. She imagined him led out
to death; thrust over the city walls; prodded with
spear; tortured on the rack; having the tongue torn
from his mouth,&mdash;for such things had recently been
done in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The cry came from her lips:</p>

<p>"Give me my father's life!"</p>

<p>"Aye, and thine with it, sweet maiden," cried
Apollonius, imagining that his prey was yielding to
his importunities.</p>

<p>But he was quickly undeceived. Deborah's whole
form seemed to expand. In the wine-dimmed eyes of
her captor she was transformed from a helpless girl
into the most queenly of women, whose dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
awed him; then into some avenging deity; a divine
apparition of purity which had come to scourge him
for his lifetime of lust and cruelty.</p>

<p>"My life?" she cried. "Can a Greek understand
this&mdash;that Elkiah would slay his daughter with his
own hand if he knew that Apollonius had touched
her?"</p>

<p>The soldier who had never quailed before men was
cowed by this woman. What was left of manhood
in him asserted itself in maudlin apology. He
sought to appease the righteous fury he had excited.</p>

<p>But it was too late. The woman was no longer a
suppliant. As a soldier is turned by excitement of
the battle into a fiend, so Deborah was turned into
a soldier, and now became her own defender. She
withdrew to the farther side of the apartment. As
she did so she caught sight of the sword of the
General lying upon a table. She noted its hilt
gemmed with jewels, and its blade etched with
heroic devices. She seized it, and sprang like a
tigress upon the unarmed man. As he crouched
back to avoid the stroke, Deborah stopped.</p>

<p>"Stay, I will not slay you like a caged beast. Let
the great Apollonius outrage a defenseless woman&mdash;a
Jewish woman would despise herself if she harmed
a defenseless Greek. The daughter of feeble Elkiah
will give the brave Apollonius a chance for his life.
Unbar the door, or let it be said that a woman
slew thee. I will not ask a pledge of a Greek to
spare my father. I would not trust the word he has
already broken. Jehovah of Israel will avenge my
father's house! Unbar the door!"</p>

<p>Apollonius flung a quick glance around to discover
a mode of escape. Had he been fully possessed of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
wits he would doubtless have found some means
of disarming his assailant. Yet the action of the
woman was so alert and resolute that most men
would have been held at bay. She poised the
weapon for its lunge. Had the Jewess learned the
art of fence? Or did the quickening of her faculties
by the intensity of her purpose supply the deficiency
of training? Her attitude was perfect for the giving
of the fatal blow. In the General's eyes at the moment,
if she were not Ares, the god of war, she was
Athena armed,&mdash;no less puissant.</p>

<p>The baffled chieftain had no alternative but submission.
Yet it was not mere submission to the
accident of her advantage. There was a sort of
voluntary homage in the way in which, half sobered
by the situation, he yielded to the inevitable.</p>

<p>"The daughter of Elkiah has won her liberty,"
said he, with a wave of his hand that nearly sent
him sprawling. He staggered to where a bronze
plate hung, and struck it. As its signal was answered
from without, he cried:</p>

<p>"Ho, Servites, let the woman pass!"</p>

<p>Without losing for an instant her attitude of caution,
Deborah passed to the doorway. Putting the
weapon beneath her robe, she said:</p>

<p>"This will I keep as the pledge of Apollonius'
honor until he shall win it back from braver hands
than his own. Our God will raise us up a defender.
The Avenger of Israel shall come."</p>

<p>Pausing a moment between the curtains which
Servites held back for her passage, and fixing upon
her captor a look of utter contempt, she drew the
sword again from her garment, and flung it ringing
upon the marble floor, with the exclamation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"But no! Let it not be said that a Hebrew girl
despoiled the General of the Greeks. Apollonius may
keep his sword until the Lord Jehovah gives us a
man strong enough to take it from him."</p>

<p>She passed out.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />

<span class="smaller">DEBORAH DISCOVERS HERSELF</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-w1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">With</span> the impulse of flight Deborah glided
out from beneath the portal of Apollonius'
palace. For a moment she
glanced backward, as if her soul
would hurl its final malediction upon
her enemy. Then she was seized with fright as she
realized her danger. The lanterns which hung
about the great doorway and throughout the
court, with their transparent screens of red and
yellow and blue, glared upon her like the eyes of
demons. She ran at first without thought of her
direction, driven by a wild impulse to escape.</p>

<p>When she reached the open street the light of the
moon, shining down serenely between the house-tops,
seemed like the white shield of some heavenly
defender to save her from the pursuing lanterns.
She paused to think. Whither should she flee?
Should she flee at all? Caleb? Surely he must be
somewhere in the place she had left. With that
thought her feet became as lead. She could not desert
the child.</p>

<p>She would go back, demand admission to the
presence of the tyrant, and risk anything, everything,
for her brother's liberation.</p>

<p>Quickly she saw the futility of this project. She
might not be readmitted, and if so, Apollonius
would now avenge himself by the accomplishment
of his original purpose. What should she do? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
she went to her home, would not some emissary
of the enraged Governor intercept her? Surely this
proud and remorseless man would not let her live
to tell the story of his shame.</p>

<p>Partly from instinctive caution, partly from the
feeling that the darkness of the night better fitted
her own uncertainty of purpose, she kept close to
the houses on the shadowed side of the narrow
street. Though she walked on rapidly, her soul
stood still, like a sentinel peering through the gloom
that echoes the step of some as yet unseen danger.</p>

<p>By her side at length loomed piles of fallen stone
and half-standing walls. These were the ruins of
what a few weeks before had been the elegant residence
of Ben Isaac, one of the wealthiest merchants
of Jerusalem. It had been razed by order of King
Antiochus, who had first pillaged its treasures and
then carried its master captive to Antioch, and there
exacted from him by torture the remnant of his
riches.</p>

<p>Deborah turned in amid the ghastly wreck. The
wild desolation so fitted her experience that the spot
seemed restful. The moon was sinking toward the
west, and poured its full lustre against a still-standing
wall. The very sharpness of the beams cut a
block of contrasted darkness on the side toward the
east. Deborah climbed over the rough stones and
hid within the shadow.</p>

<p>Beneath her lay, like snowdrifts, the squat domes
and flat roofs of the houses in the lower Street of
the Cheesemakers, once the homes of honest artisans
and tradespeople, now the sleeping-troughs of
the vile herd hired to trample out the life of the
nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond, the vision broken only by the massive
shape of the Temple on Moriah, lay the vale of Jehoshaphat,
the quiet slopes of Olivet, and the long
hills to the north glittering here and there as the
moonlight fell upon the hated tents of the enemy.
As the rising sea pours its tide into a narrow creek,
so there came upon her a sense of her nation's shame
and woe. At first her power of definite thought
seemed destroyed by the flood. Why could she not
cease also to feel? Why could she not die and become
as insensate as the stones, these other ruins
about her?</p>

<p>At length she realized a strange transformation
taking place within her; she felt that she had grown
suddenly to be no longer a child, but a woman.
Nor was she merely a woman of Jerusalem, but a
strong avenging spirit. She drank the bitterness
of her own heart, and was intoxicated, frenzied,
with it. She, who had never felt anything but love,
had now learned to hate, and it seemed good to her.
Then she became frightened at this revelation of
herself to herself. She had possessed a mastiff, gentle,
affectionate. Little blind Caleb would lie between
its great paws as in the lap of Huldah. Once
the beast was stoned upon the street. From that
day his temper was changed. He became a savage
brute; doubtless his original wild nature reasserting
itself. Was she herself not some cruel, vicious spirit
suddenly awakened?</p>

<p>She prayed, "God save me from myself!"</p>

<p>An answer came. It did not allay her excitement,
but exalted her; seemed to inspire her.</p>

<p>The music of revelry in the tents beyond the walls
became to her spiritualized senses like the timbrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and song of Miriam of old, when that woman led
the hosts of Israel by the waters of the Red Sea.
Was not her own name Deborah? and did not a
Deborah once lead her nation in battle? She remembered
how her father had bemoaned her being
only a girl, unless she could grow into another
Deborah indeed. She heard again the words of the
ancient song, "Awake! awake, Deborah! awake!
Awake! Arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive!"</p>

<p>If she could not imitate the great prophetess,
why could she not emulate the deed of Jael, who
drove the nail through the head of the sleeping
Syrian general, Sisera? Why had she not slain Apollonius?
A woman, a common woman of Israel, had
delivered her land; why should not she? She murmured
aloud the words of the Scripture, "Blessed
above all women shall Jael, the wife of Heber, the
Kenite, be; blessed shall she be above all women in
the tent."</p>

<p>Then she prayed, "Oh, God of Israel, take Thy
handmaiden for what Thou wilt&mdash;for what Thou
wilt!"</p>

<p>A chill, as of a wind from icy Hermon, ran through
her frame, though the night was not cold. Was this
the breath of the Lord? Then her blood became
like liquid fire, and burned along the veins. Was
she in communion with the divine fury? Again her
flesh felt a cooling sensation, as if fanned and softly
touched by an angel's wing. Was not an angel
with her? These experiences were repeated again
and again.</p>

<p>Long time she sat upon a stone amid the ruins.
She hailed the moonlight that lay beyond as some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
all-watchful Power; the shadow in which she sat
became like some awful Presence. Was not this a
token of God's will, approving her own thought to
become an avenger of the wrongs of her people?</p>

<p>At length the moonlight faded; the shadow disappeared,
for the dawn sent its ruddy gleams along
the east. That was to her the smile of the Lord.
Henceforth she was to be, not the daughter of Elkiah,
but the daughter of Jerusalem; the child of
her nation; the sacrifice, if need be, for her people.
The fire had been put out on the Temple altar.
Holy priests could no longer bind the brutes for
sacrifice. But the great cause of God was itself the
altar, and she&mdash;she would cling to that altar, binding
herself there by the cords of a willing consecration.
With the words of an oft-repeated psalm&mdash;words
that had a meaning infinitely deeper now
than she had ever conceived before&mdash;"Lo, I come to
do Thy will, O God; bind the sacrifice to the altar,"
she stepped out of the shadow of the wall into
the blending light of the setting moon and rising sun.</p>

<p>In an instant she darted back into her retreat.
The stalwart form of a soldier was passing; but
she was too late to escape his detection. The man
halted, put his hand above his eyes as if to brush
away the darkness, and turned in among the ruins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Captain Dion's search for Deborah in the camp of
Cleanthes beyond the Kedron had, of course, been
fruitless. As he returned to the city, what had heretofore
been a vague suspicion of the treachery of
Apollonius became a conviction, and filled him with
rage. Had he questioned himself, he would have
said that his wrath was because of the personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
insult the Governor had put upon him, in tricking
him in his purpose. He even thought of the slight
at the banquet when Apollonius refused to allow
him the honor of being Feast Master. Dion was not
aware&mdash;for he had no skill in introspection&mdash;that
he had been driven over the stones of Kedron and
through the streets of the city like a madman, by
love for a girl; that but for such fuel to his passion
his resentment against Apollonius might have died
away, or been suppressed by the sense that it was
imprudent to antagonize one so much his superior
in rank.</p>

<p>Dion's mind was somewhat confused by its own
effervescence when he passed along the street in front
of the house of Ben Isaac. His attention was drawn
by a figure moving amid the ruins. Was this some
strolling woman? Surely none would seek such a
place at such an hour. He was not superstitious,
but might not this be some shade of the slaughtered
household of Ben Isaac? or, perhaps, one of the
former servants searching furtively for jewels and
coins which were known to have been concealed in
secret nooks between the walls? His curiosity, if
not his soldierly duty, would have led him to inspect.</p>

<p>With drawn sword he strode in between the fallen
stones.</p>

<p>"Out of this!" he cried.</p>

<p>Captain Dion was a brave man, but at the moment
he preferred that any pilferer might escape
rather than he himself should encounter the ghost
of a dead Jew. With the sun rising and a goodly
rattle of a carnal weapon any self-respecting wraith
from Hades ought to flit back to his appointed
shades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned the angle of the standing wall. Surely
that was no apparition. Deborah stood with right
hand uplifted to challenge the intruder. It was the
attitude Dion had seen within Elkiah's gateway.
He would scarcely have recognized her otherwise,
so changed was she in feature by the tragedy of the
night.</p>

<p>"The daughter of Elkiah! Gods! why are you in
this place? What villainy have you fled from? Tell
me, and I swear that I shall not sheathe my sword
until you are avenged."</p>

<p>The familiar voice recalled her.</p>

<p>"The child! My Caleb!" she cried.</p>

<p>"The lad! He is at home. I found him; I brought
him."</p>

<p>Complete as had been her transformation from a
child into a spirit of vengeance, the kindly tone and
news brought by Dion made her a girl again. She
felt her weakness, her need of protection. She sat
upon a stone, and the tears which she thought had
been forever dried within her by the terrors of the
night, burst forth as from a fresh fountain.</p>

<p>"My dear Deborah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shrank from Dion's touch as he laid his hand
upon hers, but it was only for an instant; his interest
in her was evidently too sincere for her to
resent. Jew and Greek, of races divided by eternal
hatred, yet, as beneath the deepest sea the land
connects the shores, they were two human creatures.
Need and helpfulness&mdash;they are the two lobes of one
heart, and beat from common impulses. She allowed
him to take her hand in his, as even her
blind brother would have done.</p>

<p>She said nothing of Apollonius' insolence. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
she told that, our story would have been different,
for Dion's hot blood would surely have anticipated
the great Avenger who was to come.</p>

<p>As they walked toward her home, the Greek
studied furtively the face of his companion. How
changed! He assigned for it but one occasion, her
loving anxiety for her father and brother. He had
known but little of such emotions, for his own life
had been from childhood among the friends whom
rank or chance had brought him; love was to him
only a closer good comradeship. But now, through
Deborah's eyes he seemed to be looking into unknown
depths, fathomless places of the soul, while
heretofore in his intercourse with women and men,
he had sounded only the shallows.</p>

<p>As they neared the house of Elkiah, Deborah with
the frankness of a child said:</p>

<p>"The Lord reward you, sir, for your kindness to
me and to my father's house!"</p>

<p>"Will not your God reward me by letting me serve
still further one whom, before all the gods, I have
learned to love?"</p>

<p>She surely heard his words, but did not take in
their meaning. Love? Yes, for her brother Benjamin;
the love which a valiant soul has for doing
any chivalric deed; the love which is respect and
sympathy for one in distress&mdash;this was all she took
from his words. How could a Greek mean more
when speaking of love to a daughter of the race he
was commissioned to destroy?</p>

<p>With these thoughts&mdash;or was it with lack of real
thought about the significance of Dion's words?&mdash;she
entered her house, and the Greek went slowly
back to his camp.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was the twenty-fifth day of the month
Chisleu, which answers to the Roman
December. Ten days before, Apollonius,
by order of King Antiochus, had erected
in the Temple court an altar to Jupiter
Olympus. This day the crowning of the blasphemy
was to be perpetrated by the destruction of the ancient
altar of the Jews, and the pollution of the
great rock where it stood&mdash;the rock sacred in the
reverence of the nation since Abraham had there
bound his son Isaac for the sacrifice; the loadstone
of the people during the years of captivity, toward
which they prayed when they hung their harps upon
the willows by the rivers of Babylon.</p>

<p>Apollonius' invitation to the revellers of the previous
night to be present in the Temple court, was
honored by the attendance of all that company
with the exception of Captain Dion. These, the
Governor's guests of honor, occupied a platform
near to the gate of the Holy Place, while the soldiers
from barracks in the city and camps in the fields
swarmed like bees, and settled in disorderly masses
everywhere about the Temple mount. The overlooking
walls were topped with a dense array of conical
felt hats and bronze helmets, while thousands of
legs, ending in the heavy cothurn&mdash;the buskin worn
with gruesome propriety by both tragedians and
soldiers&mdash;depended from the coping, and dangled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
above the heads of the crowd that stood below.
Warriors from the mountains of Bithynia chaffed
in unintelligible speech with those from the Euphrates,
as together they clung to cornices and capitals
like chattering bats. Wherever an elevation or projection
offered a glimpse of the Temple plaza there
was a mouth full of derision for the religion of a
people that had not so much as a statue or idol to
worship.</p>

<p>At Apollonius' nod an enormous trumpet brayed
forth the signal. Men took down the bar that blocked
the gateway, where once hung the splendid doors&mdash;those
which Kallisthenes had burned. A procession,
such as might appropriately have had its rehearsal
in Pandemonium, entered the sacred precincts. It
was headed by a huge Syrian who personated the
Jewish High Priest. His gigantic proportions were
magnified by an enormous tub, which he wore on
his head to burlesque the genuine Pontiff with his
flower-shaped mitre inscribed "Holiness to the
Lord." On the breast of this buffoon was a clumsy
shield, painted coarsely in panels of twelve different
colors, to represent the Urim and Thummim, from
whose twelve mysterious jewels once flashed the
will of the Lord. The pomegranates, wrought in
silk upon the vestments of the real priest, and the
tiny bells which interspersed them, were imitated by
a string of dried gourd shells which clattered against
one another as the mountebank strode along.</p>

<p>Behind him came a herd of swine, prodded by
soldiers clad as common priests. The mock Pontiff
shouted a lewd prayer to Jehovah, and drove his
short sword into the throat of a huge black boar,
the signal for the slaughter of the herd. Obscene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
songs and shouts mingled with the death squeals of
the victims, while the blasphemers, stripping bare
their lower limbs, danced in the blood which
drenched the sacred pavement.</p>

<p>One huge sow was covered with a white blanket
on which was inscribed the four letters indicating
the name of the God of Israel. This beast was led
to what remained of the foundation of the old altar,
and there disemboweled. Her broth was scattered
about the Holy of Holies, and her offal flung
by the hilarious crowd into one another's faces.</p>

<p>Piles of the sacred Rolls, containing the Law collected
by the great scribe Ezra, were brought from
their cabinets in the Temple. These were sprinkled
with swine's filth and burned.</p>

<p>There was then led in a band of captive Jews,
mostly of the servant class, since their masters had
already been disposed of. These were stripped naked
amid hilarious taunts for the sign of their race.
Each was forced to hold a piece of the sow's flesh
in his teeth. If one allowed it to fall, he was stabbed
to death and cast among the carcasses of the beasts.</p>

<p>The crowd grew demented with their blasphemous
sport. They demanded more and more human victims.
Every Jew found in the streets was haled
with insult of tongue and the prick of spear-points
to the scene of butchery. The decree of the King
granting immunity to certain households was of
little moment. While the demonized multitude did
not dare to altogether ignore the certificate of royal
clemency which was affixed to the gates and lintels
of a favored few, private soldiers themselves assumed
to test the loyalty of the inmates.</p>

<p>Elkiah's household was thus challenged. The old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
man was dragged to his doorway and given the
alternative of worshipping Jupiter or being put to
death. He took the spices which they thrust into
his shaking hand, as if he purposed to drop them
upon the Greek altar at the gate. A howl of disappointment
rose from the crowd, who imagined
that their victim was thus escaping them; but it
soon changed to a wild cry of cruel gratification,
for Elkiah only looked a moment upon the grains,
while his lips moved in some inaudible prayer; then
he flung them into the faces of his challengers:</p>

<p>"The curse of Nadab and Abihu, who offered
strange fire upon the altar, be upon the son of
Israel who this day denies his God! The worms of
hell consume you all!"</p>

<p>Before he could be hindered Elkiah threw himself
against the little heathen altar. It fell crashing beneath
him. The next instant he was seized and
thrown like the carcass of a beast across the shoulders
of a gigantic Greek, who carried him to the
Temple. Here he was cast into a pile of patriots,
some still breathing, the most dead.</p>

<p>"The old bigot is gone at last," said his bearer.</p>

<p>"Then I will grease him for better frying over in
Gehenna," said another, as he forced a piece of
swine's fat into Elkiah's mouth.</p>

<p>The insult revived the patriot. He spat out the
uncleanness. Then a strange strength came into the
venerable man. Before hands could grasp him he
had risen to his feet. His bent form became suddenly
erect with the inspiration of his passion. The
crowd drew back a little as if the dead had come
to life. Elkiah's voice rose to a shrill outcry, and
rang above the howling of the multitude:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say the heathen, 'The sacrifice shall cease on the
altar of Jewry'? It shall not cease. I myself will
be a sacrifice. God receive my offering!"</p>

<p>He raised his clenched hands above his head and
stood an instant, glaring upon the bystanders like
the incarnation of a curse. Then he strode with
shaking steps to the side of the old altar, and before
any one could stop him threw himself upon the
stones. His frame quivered an instant as if a priest's
knife were indeed turning in his heart. Soldiers
lifted him, and flung him back upon the pavement.</p>

<p>The Jew had conquered. He had made his sacrifice
to his God. Elkiah, the Nasi, the last of the
Sanhedrin, was dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Deborah had essayed to follow her father when
his captors took him from his house. A Greek officer
seized her and forced her back.</p>

<p>"By all the gods of Greek and Jew, you shall not
go!"</p>

<p>The speaker was Dion.</p>

<p>For a little her resolution seemed to yield before
the imperiousness of her friend. But her spirit was
as a Damascus blade which, suddenly bent, springs
back into shape. With a wild cry, "I will go to
my father; they shall not harm him!" she broke
from Dion. His stronger arms regained her.</p>

<p>"You will not be harmed if you stay here," Dion
said; "but both you and your father will perish if
you go. None but I can save you, Deborah. By my
love I entreat."</p>

<p>"Your love! your love!" There was utter contempt
in her tone. "You, a hired slaughterer of
our people!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, then by my strength you shall not go."</p>

<p>He grasped her wrists. The might of her soul
was imparted to her arms, and she had nearly freed
herself. It required a rough grip of even the athlete's
strong hands to detain her. His hard fingers
deeply indented her softer flesh. Her face was contorted
with pain. Dion relaxed his hold, but not
enough to allow her to escape.</p>

<p>So close they stood that their breaths mingled.
If soul were breath, as the one Hebrew word for
both signifies, it might be that their spirits touched
and mingled also; for the fire slowly died from her eyes.</p>

<p>"You are stronger than I," she said, with panting
breath.</p>

<p>"Forgive my use of force," replied Dion; "but I
had to choose between offending and saving you.
I have seen too many cruelties to dare to let you
go from the door."</p>

<p>Deborah's look searched Dion to the heart. She
spoke with slow accents, as if uncertain whether
to venture the words:</p>

<p>"I will trust you, though a Greek. Let no harm
come to my father."</p>

<p>"If man can save him, I will. But do you pledge
me, Deborah, that you will not go to the streets.
A flower would be safer thrown there under the
feet of the mob than you among the soldiers. Pledge
me, I beg you; pledge me."</p>

<p>"Then I will wait. But fly! oh, Dion, fly! Your
word! Your sword if need be! My father! Oh,
my father!"</p>

<p>Dion was gone.</p>

<p>As the Greek hurried away only the arm of the
old servant Huldah prevented Deborah falling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the pavement. She moved close to the street door,
but did not open it. There she stood, not unlike
the statue of a runner whose whole attitude shows
flight while the feet are motionless. She had almost
broken her pledge and gone after Dion, but something
held her back. Was it her word? She did
not think of that. It was rather the word of the
Greek; for had he not said, "If man can save him,
I will"? She saw that in this man of hated race
was the only hope. If he should fail, then God had
willed the worst, and she would submit.</p>

<p>Submit? To what? To grief? To bereavement?
Yes. To insult? Perhaps to death, for the assailants
of her father would not spare his child.</p>

<p>But there was another submission she deliberately
contemplated. It was submission to the overmastering
passion which had been born last night amid
the ruins of the house of Ben Isaac&mdash;to become a
minister of vengeance for her people. She seemed
to hear her father's voice above the din of the street
calling her to avenge his name. The shades of the
martyrs of Israel in her excited imagination trooped
from Sheol, and stood around her as if to lay their
hands upon her in ordination to a life entirely devoted
to patriotism and religion; devoted, whether
with her hands red in the blood of Israel's enemies,
or white with nursing service of Israel's distressed
people, she knew not, she cared not.</p>

<p>She was aroused from her reverie by the voice of
Caleb.</p>

<p>"Sister, shall we not flee? Death is over the house.
They have slain our father. I but now heard the
passers-by say, 'Elkiah is dead.'"</p>

<p>"Flee, child? Whither can we flee? The angel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
destruction hovers over us, his wings black, oh, so
black! and over all the city, and over all the land.
We are safe for the moment only here. We must
wait on the Lord, and&mdash;on the Greek!"</p>

<p>"Has fear driven away your memory, sister dear?"
said Caleb. "There are passages from our home
into the great quarry which underlies the city."</p>

<p>"True, child, but we have never learned them."</p>

<p>"But I have. I go where those who can see find
no way. From the cellar of our house a way opens
into the cellar of our neighbor Moses, and from that
into the cellar of Omri. They both fled that way.
I heard them beg father to escape with them, but
he would not. He declared that he would die in
Jerusalem rather than flee so long as the altar of
the Lord stood on Moriah. But the altar has fallen,
sister; the people in the streets just now said that
not a stone of it stood any longer. Were our father
here, he would now flee. Come! Benjamin will be
safe, since he has become as one of the Greeks, and
Dion will care for him. Come! I can guide you,
and God will guide me as He always has done.
Come!"</p>

<p>"Nay, child, the daughter of Elkiah cannot leave
her house while her father lives. He will return&mdash;or
Dion."</p>

<p>"But our father will not come again," urged the
child. "Did I not hear them say, 'The Jew is dead'?
Come!"</p>

<p>"I will not believe it until Dion returns and tells
me with his own lips. They will not, they dare not
kill my father. Besides, I have given the Greek my
word."</p>

<p>"Your word to a Greek! What is there in that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"True, only my word to a Greek! To a Greek!
Then let us go for your sake, child."</p>

<p>She followed the blind boy as he darted across the
court to the door which opened into the servants'
apartment, and thence into the cellar. At the entrance
she stopped.</p>

<p>"Nay, child, I cannot go. I have given him my
word."</p>

<p>"Trust not the Greek," cried Caleb. "He will not
come back. He dare not if he would. They would
kill him if he befriended us or our father. But
hark!"</p>

<p>The blind boy stood in an attitude of listening.
Then he cried excitedly, "Aye! He comes. I hear
Captain Dion's voice in the street. He has turned
the corner&mdash;now he is at the door."</p>

<p>Dion stood before them.</p>

<p>For a little he was speechless, as if the words he
would speak were too cruel to utter. He did not
even lift his eyes to the young woman's face.</p>

<p>"Do not speak, sir!" said Deborah. "I know it
all. My father has been slain by your people."</p>

<p>"Nay, not slain," replied the Greek. "Your father's
God has taken him. As Zeus lives&mdash;as Jehovah lives&mdash;Elkiah
died as only the greatest and best of men
can die; no hand struck the blow. On the steps of
the altar of his God he himself gave up his life.
The gods take the breath of such men with a kiss."</p>

<p>Deborah bowed herself upon the pavement.</p>

<p>"Aye, he was a sacrifice. Oh, my father!" Then
she rose. Her eyes seemed to see the ascended spirit
as she said slowly:</p>

<p>"Now I swear by thy white locks&mdash;by the altar
of thy broken heart! I, too, will be a sacrifice!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The Greek was paralyzed by the sense of his helplessness
to say or do anything to mitigate the
woman's woe. Though he knew not what it meant,
he knew that there was a tragedy in her heart as
real as the one that had just occurred at the Temple.</p>

<p>Dion lingered to offer&mdash;what? Comfort? Help?
Perhaps he acted simply from the instinct by which
noble natures wait to give themselves to others for
whatever may be needed. One thing he could do.</p>

<p>"Your father shall have honorable interment. I
have secured from Apollonius the order that he be
buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. With your
brother's sickness and the hazard to your life and
that of Caleb, I ask your permission that I may be
his mourner."</p>

<p>"My thanks, good sir. And my father's God will
bless you."</p>

<p>Still Dion lingered, until Deborah herself said:</p>

<p>"Captain Dion, you must go away. This house is
no place for a Greek."</p>

<p>"Nay, it is the place for such a Greek as I. Let
me help you. Tell me your desire, and it shall be
done."</p>

<p>Deborah did not look at her companion. Advancing
to the centre of the court where the sun gleamed
fairly upon her, she raised her hand. It was not
now the attitude of defense from danger such as
Dion had seen before. It was not that of daring
which had cowed the besotted Apollonius. It was
that of supreme spiritual exaltation. It seemed to
enlarge her physical form and to transfigure her
countenance with the strong glow of inner light.
Dion had seen the priestesses of almost every shrine
among his own and foreign peoples, but nothing so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
august as this self-ordination of the Jewish maiden
to her mysterious service, as she said in suppressed
tones:</p>

<p>"Now, O God of my father, I will fulfill my vow!
Lead Thou whither Thou wilt. Guide me as Thou
hast all true sons and daughters of Israel. Amen!"</p>

<p>Then her eyes rested a moment upon Dion's. A
faint smile, or rather the slightest yielding of the
rigidness of her alabaster features, denoted a not
unkind recognition. If her voice was softened, it
lost no tone of determination as she repeated:</p>

<p>"You must go away. I shall need no further help."</p>

<p>"You know not what you say," replied Dion
eagerly. "You are utterly helpless here. Your
brother's name will not save you one moment from
the danger which I know will follow you. You
must flee. Can you conceal yourself for a little
while? I will return with the dress of a Greek
woman, and in that disguise I can take you to a
place of safety."</p>

<p>"Nay, go you and bury my father," said she.</p>

<p>"Promise me that you will not pass into the
street."</p>

<p>"I will not go&mdash;into the street."</p>

<p>"The gods be praised!" cried Dion. He seized her
hand, and before she could withdraw it had pressed
it to his lips. Then he hastened away.</p>

<p>Caleb had been a silent auditor of all this. Now
he ran to his sister's side.</p>

<p>"Not with the Greek, Deborah, with me. You
said, only, 'Not into the street'."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will go with you, child. And may your
blind eyes see the way of the Lord!"</p>

<p>She passed into the chamber where Benjamin lay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
The leech had pronounced his healing sure, though
he was not yet recovered from his stupor. Deborah
softly imprinted a kiss upon her brother's forehead.
She glanced at the familiar objects in the apartment,
most of which were sacred with memories. At
length her eyes rested upon a little ivory shrine of
the Greek Aphrodite, a token of the new religion
her brother had embraced. Then she fled from the
desecrated chamber.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Jerusalem</span> crowns a massive ridge of
rock. To the eye of the inhabitant this
was a projecting portion of the very
foundation of the earth; to his faith
it was the symbol of the eternity of the
Jewish religion. The rock is not, however, as solid
as it seems. For ages it has served as the quarry
from which the builders of walls and fortresses,
pavements and palaces, have taken their material,
leaving little more than the shell of the dome which
first attracted the worshipful gaze of Abraham as he
journeyed up from the south country. The rock of
Moriah may then be taken as a symbol of the hollow
formality into which the religion of Israel has
at times degenerated. In the time of our story there
were, beneath the streets and houses of the city,
long labyrinthine passages that were unlighted except
by the occasional lantern of an explorer or
prowler, and vast chambers where no sound, save
of some cautious footstep, had echoed since the click
of the hammer of the Ph&oelig;nician stone-cutter in the
days of Hiram, the royal friend of Solomon, whose
Tyrian artisans built the Temple.</p>

<p>In the flight of Deborah and Caleb, the lad led the
way first to the upper cellar of the house of Elkiah.
The floor of this was laid in well-squared blocks of
white marble, cornered with smaller blocks in black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
making an artistic pattern which could be discerned
in the dim light that now fell upon it. In ancient
times this cellar floor had been the pavement of an
upper court, and opened to the full daylight; for
Jerusalem had been again and again destroyed and
rebuilt upon its own ruins.</p>

<p>Passing through this cellar the fugitives struck a
series of winding stone steps which brought them to
a sub-cellar. Here the darkness was dense. Caleb
stood a moment with his hands extended, as if
possessing eyes in his finger-tips.</p>

<p>"I have it. The air comes this way. I can feel it
as it oozes up from the cracks about the loose trap-door,
as easily as you, Deborah, could see the light
around window shutters. Here is the trap. The
stone tilts. It is hung on an iron bar. The big end
of the stone rests on a rim, and is enough heavier to
prevent the other end from sinking when one steps
on it, but not heavier than you and I can lift.
Uriah and I have often opened it, and he is no
stronger than I am. Your fingers here, Deborah."</p>

<p>As the stone was tilted there came up a stream of
damp, chilly air, which, Caleb said, was "the breath
of the thousand toads and bats that live in the
crannies below."</p>

<p>The blind boy leaped unhesitatingly into the black
depths.</p>

<p>"It's smooth here, sister. The old Ph&oelig;nicians
swept up all their stone chips before they went home.
I could run barefoot here without stubbing my
toe."</p>

<p>Deborah let herself cautiously down into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Ah," said she, as she felt the solid level beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
her feet, "if we could only trust God as easily as I
can trust my child!"</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't we, dear heart?" replied the
boy. "God says, 'I will guide thee with mine eye.'
Hasn't He done so with me?"</p>

<p>He took his sister's hand and led on boldly for a
few paces.</p>

<p>"Wait. Yes, we turn this way, for the air comes
from this direction. Stoop, sister! Uriah once
bumped his head here. Now we are past it. Uriah
said the roof here was twenty cubits high, and was
held up by big pillars of the rock which hadn't been
cut away. One day he lit a lamp in here, and the
bats flew about like black shooting-stars. Listen!
That's the water that comes from Solomon's Pools,
down by Bethlehem; the same that spouts up in
our fountain. And that drip, drip, drip&mdash;Uriah said
it was the dying heart-beats of our nation. God
make him mistaken for once! It's nothing but
leaks. And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Caleb did not finish his sentence. Even Deborah
exclaimed in alarm. A sharp cry rang through the
cavernous passage. At the next instant Caleb was
thrown from his feet. Something large, yet soft,
brushed him. He heard the quick snapping of teeth,
then a rustling beyond them, which suddenly ceased.</p>

<p>"It's only a fox. Uriah said that one day he
chased one into the big crack in the north wall.
Lots of them must live in here, or else foxes haven't
got the wit they are thought to have."</p>

<p>A little further on the fugitives felt the air to be
fresher and warmer. A light flickered in the distance.
It seemed to Deborah to come through a
window with shifting lattice-work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the opening through the city wall, not
far from the north gate," said Caleb. "It is covered
up with bushes on the outside. That's the reason
the soldiers haven't found it yet. The wind
blows the bushes like a curtain, Uriah says, and it
makes the light blink."</p>

<p>The exit from the cavern through the city wall
was very narrow, a mere crevice between the great
stones which some earthquake, or possibly the
stroke of some battering-ram, had dislodged.</p>

<p>"Let me look out, sister. I can see with my ears
without pushing the bushes."</p>

<p>Caleb lifted himself to the aperture, and crawled
into it, where he lay for a moment as still as a
lizard. He suddenly slipped down again to his sister's
side.</p>

<p>"A sentinel is passing. He is a big, awkward
fellow, for I hear his feet roll on the little stones.
Now he has gone. The soldiers are afraid to come
among the bushes or close to the walls, because
the cracks in the stones are full of little adders.
But they never harm me."</p>

<p>"The Psalm reads," said Deborah, "'Thou shalt
tread upon the lion and adder.'"</p>

<p>"But," rejoined the lad, "I don't even tread on
them. One day, though, I put my hand on one,
and he didn't bite me. Maybe that is what the Lord
means, too."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied his sister, "for Esaias says, 'The
sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and
the weaned child shall put his hand in the cockatrice's
den.' But that is to be when Jerusalem is
redeemed by a new David. God grant that your
safety from these reptiles may mean that glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
days are near at hand. The Deliverer must come.
He must come. Maybe we shall see Him, Caleb."</p>

<p>So they talked in whispers while the aperture
grew dim with approaching night.</p>

<p>Caleb and Deborah did not venture to come out
of the old city quarry until darkness had fully fallen,
and the ray of a star shot its salutation to them
through the crevice. When they emerged they stood
for a long time close to the wall, screened by the
bushes.</p>

<p>"How large the stars look!" whispered Deborah.
"They hang as in mid-air; the constellations like
ear-rings and necklaces on the invisible angels. They
seem nearer than the camp-fires and tent lanterns
of the Greeks on the hills yonder. So let us trust
Heaven's help is nearer to us than our enemies."</p>

<p>"Amen!" rejoined Caleb.</p>

<p>Deborah glanced upward at the majestic march
of what Caleb said were "God's Helmets," and then
along the line of the Greek encampment, as she exclaimed,
"O stars that fought in their courses
against Sisera, fight against Apollonius!"</p>

<p>Caleb started, pressing his sister's hand. "Are
the stars moving, sister?"</p>

<p>"No, child; it is but the night winds warring
against the high walls of the city. The stars hear
no command of the Lord as yet."</p>

<p>"But listen!" again interposed the excited child.</p>

<p>"No, that is only the wind among the olives in
the old garden of Kedron," replied Deborah.</p>

<p>"But was there not once the 'sound of a going in
the tops of the mulberry trees' that told David the
Lord went before him to battle?" quoted the child.</p>

<p>"Oh, if God would be to us as thy faith, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
child!" and Deborah stooped to kiss his forehead
as they hurried away.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to avoid the soldiers, for,
with the exception of an occasional sentry posted
along the high road, the companies kept within
their various camps. The Greeks had learned lessons
in caution during their brief occupancy of Palestine
such as had not been needed in the other
countries they had subjugated. It was quite a common
thing in the neighborhood of Jerusalem for
sentinels never to return from their beats. Small
companies of guards sometimes disappeared mysteriously,
as if swallowed by earthquakes which
made no rumble and closed their lips in silence.
Even close to the camps men dropped in their tracks,
while a stone, the size of one's fist, went clattering
over the ground, leaving its mark in a broken skull
or a mangled face; for the Jewish herdsmen were
still as expert with the sling as they were in the
days of David. Rumor attributed many of these
daring exploits to a single family, five young men,
the sons of a priest in Modin, chief of whom in this
outlawry was Judas, reputed a giant.</p>

<p>Deborah and Caleb were comparatively safe, for
they did not attempt the highways, nor even the
beaten footpaths, but passed hastily across the
stony fields, and glided crouching between the vine-rows
on cultivated terraces. Now they paused to
listen in the deeper shadows, by some gnarled olive
whose dusky branches made the night darker; again,
they hid behind the broad-bottomed cypresses if
noise were heard; then, utterly wearied, they rested
quietly for a few moments under the fig-trees.</p>

<p>Their course brought the fugitives beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
frowning palisades of solid rock into which were
cut the tombs of the Judges. These had no terrors
for Deborah. Indeed, she lingered as if to commune
with those departed spirits who might be near to
the gates of Sheol listening for tidings from the
upper world. Did these heroes of old still live? Were
they unconscious of the awful fate that had fallen
upon their land? Were there no powers among them
which could return to the visible world and avenge
the sorrows of those who are still forced to endure
existence in the flesh? She remembered that once she
had been poisoned by passing a noxious plant. Now
she wondered if the other world had no destroying
breath with which to slay the Greeks. Would not
the soul of Elkiah, the righteous, stir up the abode
of the dead by his coming, and by the story of his
wrongs? Was Jehovah dead, too?</p>

<p>She condemned such thoughts as blasphemous and
pushed on.</p>

<p>Only the stumbling of their feet against the stones
broke the night silence.</p>

<p>At length dawn began to pour over the mountains
of Moab. The jagged peaks far to the east,
like prisms, unwound the white light and twisted
its threads into robes of purple and orange, and
transformed snowy points here and there into diamond
and pearl. Deborah felt the inspiration of
the scene. Surely the chariots and horses of God
must charge from the sky, if Jehovah were indeed
the "Lord of Hosts."</p>

<p>A noble hill rose before the fugitives; this was
Mizpah. Here, as Deborah related, was where Samuel
gathered the faithful to smite the Philistines,
and down these very slopes God pursued the ene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>mies
of Israel with His thunders. Some one of these
great stones might be the very stone Samuel had
set up and called "Ebenezer," to commemorate the
Lord's help. Oh, if she knew which it was, that
she might kneel beside it, and repeat aloud the vow
to serve her country's God!</p>

<p>On the hill gleamed the white, flat roofs of the
houses of the little city of Mizpah, just showing
themselves above the brown walls. Should she
hasten onward? The fatigue of the long, excited
tramp, the chill of the night, which the warm glow
in the distant east seemed to drive deeper into their
aching flesh, the human longing for companionship,
and the hope of help urged her forward. She would
enter Mizpah. There must be many there who had
known Elkiah, and would protect his children.</p>

<p>But what was that which the dawning light
made suddenly visible against the background of
the walls? Alas! Deborah was too familiar with
the ubiquitous banner flying from the spear-head.
Mizpah, like Jerusalem, was occupied by the enemy.
To go nearer was to court the very danger from
which they were fleeing. But to flee again was too
much for exhausted flesh. The shock of this discovery
paralyzed her remaining energy. She tried
to cling to the side of the rock against which she
had been leaning. She fell fainting at its base.</p>

<p>Then the brain, too much excited, and unchecked
by will, wrought its usual work. Memory and
imagination became confused. The hill of Mizpah
appeared to her repeopled with its ancient inhabitants.
Old scenes of which she had read took the
place of those she had just witnessed. The Greek
tents became those of the ancient Philistines. Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
should deliver Israel? She thought that the tall
form of Saul, son of Kish, strode again along the
slope of Mizpah, looking for his father's asses.
Where was Samuel with the horn to anoint him
king?</p>

<p>A full flash of the sun bursting over the eastern
mountains revived her. Did it awaken her, or
merely vitalize and make real her dream? She could
not tell, for though this was Caleb sleeping by her
side, surely yonder was Saul. His herdsman's dress
could not disguise his kingly bearing. It needed not
the prophetic gift of Samuel to distinguish the
Lord's anointed. So stalwart was he, a head taller
than most men; so majestic of mien; so noble of
countenance. The apparition came near. It stood
over her, taller than the rock, and seeming stronger.
It bent down to her, and then it spoke:</p>

<p>"My children, why are you here?"</p>

<p>The voice aroused Caleb. His movement and the
quick grasp of his sister's hand brought Deborah
fully back from her dream. She pressed her eyes,
if possible to press out any mere illusion; but the
figure of Saul was still there.</p>

<p>He repeated his question, "Why are you here, children?"</p>

<p>Kindly he gave a hand to the startled girl. She
grasped it, partly to discover whether it were real or
a phantom; partly because she was so weak in flesh
and will that she would have grasped any human
hand that did not strike her or wear the mail of the
hated Greek. She rose to her feet. The stranger
started as if he, too, were uncertain whether this
were not an apparition; for Deborah was not a
child, as her face asleep had betokened, but now a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
woman. Into her youthful features the sharp suffering
of a few days had put those lines which ordinarily
come only of mature years and slow corroding
care. Her black eyes had sunken deeper into
their sockets. Their gleam seemed to be a reflection
from some inner mirror of the soul, rather than a
direct outlook,&mdash;that resilience of intense introspection
which martyrs have in their eyes when they
gaze upon those who have come to see them
die.</p>

<p>The stranger's manner became that of reverential
sympathy.</p>

<p>"My good woman, how came you here? And who
are you? Where is your home?"</p>

<p>Deborah's uncertainty as to her own identity was
at that moment nearly as great as that of her
inquirer. She gazed intently into his face until she
could assure herself that she was waking.</p>

<p>"My home, sir, is nowhere and everywhere. When
the nest is destroyed the birds' home is on any tree
or rock, and God provides for them. Such is our
only refuge. I am a daughter of Jerusalem. We are
children of Elkiah, son of Reuben."</p>

<p>"Then the news I have heard is true," exclaimed
the man excitedly. "God of Israel, avenge thy
murdered saints!"</p>

<p>The face of the stranger underwent a contortion
that transformed it. Had Deborah seen this aspect
first she had not dared to trust the man; so wrathful,
so cruel he looked. But instantly his expression
reverted to kindliness. There came into it a wonderful
benignity. His eye was as clear a fountain of
honesty and affection as the sun is of light. Every
lineament also spoke of courage that matched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
tremendous strength which his stalwart frame and
protruding muscles displayed.</p>

<p>Deborah briefly narrated the events of recent
hours.</p>

<p>"And you, sir? Who are you that dares speak
kindly to one whom even God seems to have forgotten?"</p>

<p>"I am Judas, son of Mattathias, the priest of
Modin. But it is enough that I am a son of Israel
and your protector," showing a stout sword beneath
his herdsman's goatskin shirt. "A few of us
have given ourselves during these dangerous times to
the help of the fugitives from the Sacred City, and I
thank our Lord that He has directed me to this
spot where I may serve the house of Elkiah. But
here, my children, you cannot remain; nor can you
enter the town yonder. You must go with me. I
will see you safely among those who revere your
father's name, and are brave enough to defend his
children as they would their own."</p>

<p>He took the lad into his strong hands, and placed
him astride his shoulder.</p>

<p>Avoiding the open places, and as much as possible
keeping the rocks between them and Mizpah, he led
the way down the hill, skirting its northern base.
At length they struck the bed of a brook, which,
though torn by the winter freshets, was now dry.
Scarcely had they begun to follow its water-whitened
stones when they were challenged. A
Greek sentinel strode out before them.</p>

<p>"The password!"</p>

<p>Judas leisurely placed Caleb upon the ground.
His bowed attitude was that of a lion when he is
about to spring upon his prey, and, swift as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
king of beasts, the Jew was upon the sentinel.
Bending him backward, his iron grip was about the
challenger's throat. In another instant the Greek's
skull was shattered against a stone.</p>

<p>Judas stood a moment, grim as a fiend, contemplating
his work. Then his lips moved:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, O my God! But was not my frenzy
Thine, O Avenger of Israel?"</p>

<p>Gradually his harsh features relaxed. He glanced
at his helpless charge, then at the dead body. He
sat down and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Demon or angel, into whose hands have I fallen?"
murmured Deborah, for her rescuer seemed either less
or more than man.</p>

<p>A moment later the opening between the rocks
where they stood was shadowed. A Greek armor
blocked the way.</p>

<p>Deborah uttered a cry of horror. Surely they
were entrapped. But her guide advancing familiarly
embraced the intruder. The stranger, removing his
broad-brimmed Greek hat, showed a head marvelously
like the other's; the same bristling red hair,
broad forehead and decidedly aquiline nose. Though
not so tall as Judas, the newcomer was equally
broad-shouldered and as compactly built; his arms
longer in proportion to the body; his calves more
knotty. If Judas were a lion, this man was of a
panther's build.</p>

<p>"The attempt succeeded, brother Jonathan?" inquired
Judas.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," replied the seeming Greek. "I spent
the night within the walls of Mizpah, and learned
that Apollonius has about twenty thousand between
Jerusalem and the sea."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"So many? And we are a brood of partridges
before the hawks."</p>

<p>"But Elijah's God is left, brother Judas."</p>

<p>"Aye, but there is no Elijah."</p>

<p>"Say not so. Elijah was not Elijah until God
called him, and made him feel the truth his name
signified,&mdash;Elijah, 'whose God is Jehovah.' And God
can call whom He will, and whom He calls, He will
empower. Gideon was hiding his wheat from the
Philistines, when the Lord said, 'Go, in this thy
might, and thou shalt save Israel.' To whom may
He not speak? And woe to the man unto whom
the Lord speaks, if he shall not obey, though he be
a Simon or a Judas. Our father's house is not like
Gideon's, least in the tribe; nor are you, Judas,
least in our father's house."</p>

<p>"Enough of this talk, Jonathan," replied Judas.
"Our swords are only sharp enough to drink the
blood of the enemies of the Lord; not bright enough
to lead the host. Such words as yours savor of
blasphemy. I will have none of them further. But
these children of Jerusalem are in need. Take care
of them. I must away. You have all the lads of
Modin accounted for?"</p>

<p>"Every one at his station."</p>

<p>"No Greeks on Bethhoron?"</p>

<p>"Not out of the town walls, or their souls would
flee their bodies as soon as their bodies left the
covert."</p>

<p>"It is well."</p>

<p>Judas donned the Greek armor which his brother
Jonathan had taken off.</p>

<p>"The Lord watch over you, my lady!"</p>

<p>His farewell was spoken with that mixture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
humility and dignity which only men who are conscious
of their own exaltation, either of rank or
character, can exhibit in rendering service.</p>

<p>"Your father is Mattathias?" asked Deborah of
Jonathan, when Judas was gone. "Is he not very
old? Surely he has often been with my father in
Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"Alas, Mattathias is old, or our cause would not
lack a leader. But these events are too much for
him. His life burns rapidly with the excitement, and
the news of good Elkiah's death will make it burn
the faster; for Mattathias is as old as Elkiah was,
though less broken. Yet I well know that his life is
only a breath of the Lord. Our father has five sons.
Simon is the eldest and wisest; but there is that
about our Judas which marks him for the leader.
To his care is due the fact that these hills are so
guarded that not even a little waif of Judaism like
that blind child can lose his way. But Judas does
not yet believe in himself. The Lord open his eyes,
or send us another leader, else the people will perish.
But you should rest."</p>

<p>Jonathan sought for his charge a little nook in the
side of a ravine. Even the hard ground was inviting,
for Deborah's limbs ached sorely from the unaccustomed
strain of the past few hours. The quiet
of the dell, and the knowledge that eyes as friendly
as they were sharp watched over her, came as a
sweet relief from the incessant fright of their journey.
Long time she lay endeavoring to catch some of the
calm out of the white clouds that floated above her;
or listening to the hum of insects and the calls of
birds, while she thanked God that there were creatures
less savage than man. At length nature as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>serted
its claim, and, with Caleb in her arms, she
fell asleep. Jonathan came and threw over them a
coarse outer garment such as the better class of
peasants wore; but the fugitives were as unaware of
their friend's deeds as of the thoughts which passed
through his mind when from time to time he came
and stood awhile beside them. Darkness fell. Their
guardian let them sleep.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when he roused them, and
the journey was resumed. Over hills and across
ravines, avoiding the usual footpath, they toiled on,
Jonathan carrying Caleb on his shoulder, and Deborah
borrowing strength of limb from her indomitable
spirit, until the stars faded in the dawning
light.</p>

<h2>XI<br />

<span class="smaller">THE PRIEST'S KNIFE</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Toward</span> noon of the next day the party
came near to the little city of Modin.
They paused to take in the view from
an adjacent hilltop. Far to the west
glistened the waters of the Great Sea,
bordered by the blazing yellow of the sand-dunes
that divide that vast blue waste from the rich plains
of Sharon. The brief chill of winter had not despoiled
this fertile tract of the beauty in which the
other seasons had arrayed it. Yonder glowed the
white walls of Lydda, like a pearl in a setting of
emerald. Many quiet villages looked out from beneath
their brows of dusky olive-trees, and gardens
sent their challenge of life to the gray limestone rocks
which seemed to bind the hills in sterility.</p>

<p>At length Deborah's gaze was diverted from this
fascinating view by a strange sight. A conical knoll
rises before Modin. This was crowded with an
excited multitude. The gay attire of some of the
people proclaimed a festival, while the movements of
others upon the outskirts of the crowd were rather
suggestive of an angry mob than of a happy concourse.
Upon the summit of the knoll stood an
altar. It was made of wood, but painted to resemble
ivory ornamented with bands of gold. Its
graceful shape supported a basin or brazier of burning
coals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The altar was surrounded by a detachment of
Greek soldiers mingled with a small group of civilians.
These latter were of various races: Ph&oelig;nicians
from the coast, who happened to be detained
in Modin by their business as traders; men of Moab
and other strolling tribesmen from beyond the land
of Judea, who had less contempt for the frivolous
rites of the Greek than hatred of the severer worship
of the Jews, which they were willing to see supplanted;
Samaritans, whose kinsmen at Shechem
had already obeyed the commands of Antiochus, and
offered heathen sacrifice upon their temple heights of
Gerizim; and renegade Jews, only too willing to believe
that the new religion was favored of heaven,
since its observance on their part brought them
immunity from confiscation of goods and bodily
harm. In the crowd were a score or more women,
the camp-followers of the Greeks, whose tawdry
finery afforded a rather pleasing contrast with the
polished metal and stiff forms of the soldiers. All
were crowned with sprigs of ivy, for the rite now in
progress was in honor of Bacchus. Female flute-players,
with skirts split to their thighs, led the
dance, and were followed about by companies of
half-drunken men and youths, who observed so
much of the steps as their unsteady legs permitted.</p>

<p>Avoiding this crowd, Jonathan brought Deborah
and Caleb near to the gate of the town. Here was
a very different scene. The native populace swarmed
under the shadow of the wall. It was evident that
these people were of a temper utterly hostile to that
which swayed the devotees about the altar of Bacchus.
In the centre of this crowd stood an officer
of the King. By his side was the herald, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
just completed reading a proclamation commanding
all persons above twelve years of age to make an
offering to Bacchus before the sun should set, under
penalty of being put to death.</p>

<p>The cruel mandate evoked cries of fright and fury
from the people. Some shrieked wildly with alarm,
well knowing the terrible alternative of apostacy or
death, and knowing also that in almost every household
there were those who would deliberately choose
the latter. Some cursed deeply, and glared upon the
officials with eyes not unlike those of wild beasts
answering the challenge of their captors. Then uprose
that strange lamentation in which Eastern
people are accustomed to express their grief&mdash;agonized
outcries accompanied by tearing the hair, rending
garments, and flinging handfuls of dust in the air.</p>

<p>In the throng was an old man. Though many
years had whitened his locks, his form was erect
and evidenced the strength and vigor of well-kept
manhood. His face was strikingly beautiful, its
lineaments such as are formed only by the habit
of lofty thinking and gentle impulses. Deborah
could not but recall the faces of her two guides
from Mizpah, which this one resembled.</p>

<p>"Venerable sir," said the Greek officer, "you are
ruler here, and as their priest high in honor among
this people. Your words they obey. Your example
they follow. You are their shepherd. Why should
you lead them into needless calamity? Come, then,
and fulfill the King's demand. It is but a little
thing required of you; not to disobey your nation's
God, but to recognize the gods of others. Surely,
some power beyond our own makes the vine grow,
and fills its clusters with wine. Call that power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Bacchus, or think of it by the nameless name of
your own God&mdash;what matters it? Recognize that
power by casting a pinch of incense upon the altar.
Pray as you please in the depths of your soul; only
do this little act. Will you lead the people to slaughter
for so simple a thing as a crushed berry of spice,
or drop of oil from a pressed olive? The great King
Antiochus would delight to favor with riches the
noble Mattathias, of whose devotion to Jewry he
has heard so much; and he longs to have such
faithful servants as you and your stalwart sons to
promote his own generous rule over these lands
which the gods have given him."</p>

<p>The King's officer would have proceeded further,
but the impatience of the old man prevented him.
Raising his voice, he cried out:</p>

<p>"Let Antiochus know, that, though all nations
that are now under the King's dominion obey him,
and fall away every one from the religion of their
fathers, yet will I, and my sons, and my brethren
walk in the ancient covenant. We will not hearken
to the King's words, to go from our religion, either
to the right or to the left."</p>

<p>"The priest is mad with bigotry, and would destroy
us. Let us go and sacrifice," said one, moving
from the crowd toward the altar on the knoll.</p>

<p>Mattathias gazed upon the renegade. A look of
unutterable pity overspread his features.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not sin thus against the Lord our
God, brother Laban," said he, as he laid his strong
hand upon the other's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Is Mattathias still a priest to kill as if we were
sheep for sacrifice? Unhand me, lest I smite thee in
spite of thy years," said Laban.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, a priest still," cried the old man, suddenly
transported with rage, "priest still to sacrifice. It
is better that the dust of the ground of our Holy
Land receive the blood of Laban than that the altar
of the heathen receive his offering."</p>

<p>He drew from his robe a priest's knife and drove
it into the heart of the traitor.</p>

<p>As the body fell the venerable man broke out into
lamentation, "Oh, my brother Laban, why didst
thou drive me so mad? O my God, forgive me,
save me! Save Thy people!"</p>

<p>The King's officer sounded an alarm, and soldiers
hastened from the adjacent knoll. But these were
soon overpowered by the infuriated mob of Jews;
and from the mêlée was dragged forth the dead
body of the Greek Commandant himself.</p>

<p>Mattathias stood a moment and gazed upon the
bruised and bleeding form of the officer. Then he
raised his hands and, with face uplifted to the white
clouds that floated above, he cried:</p>

<p>"O God of Israel, forgive Thy priest! Forgive
Thy people if they have this day been led into sin.
But Thou, Lord, knowest our hearts. The zeal of
Thine house hath eaten us up!"</p>

<p>Then he turned to the people. All fury suddenly
died from his features. Instead there came a look
of wonderful compassion and solicitude. It was as
the clear azure following the thunder-storm.</p>

<p>"To your homes, friends! To your closets! Let
no one eat this day, but with fasting let us spread
our woes before the Lord. I know, I know that
He will appear for us. For we are His people and
the sheep of His pasture. But alas! who shall be
the Avenger?"</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FORT OF THE ROCKS</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">At</span> the bidding of Mattathias, the people
passed hurriedly into the town. The
stones of the street were torn up; some
of them piled in heavy masses against
the city gates; others carried to the
walls, ready to be hurled down upon assailants.
In vain did those returning from the knoll, where
they had taken part in the heathen worship, seek
admission. Their rapping and calls to their fellow-townsmen
were answered by taunts. Mattathias
insisted on their exclusion, lest there should be division
in counsel and action, while he foresaw that
there was no alternative other than fighting for
their lives, or voluntarily surrendering themselves to
the atrocities of the foe. A low wail of lamentation
could be heard from hundreds of homes, like the
murmur of a torrent. Now and then it broke into
a sharp cry of defiance from maddened groups on the
house-tops, as a torrent leaps and splashes high in
air over some sharp obstacle that opposes its course.</p>

<p>The night that followed was one of fearful expectancy
in Modin. The news of the assault upon
the King's representative might bring the Greek
soldiers, who were scattered along Bethhoron, in
retaliatory vengeance. But the sentinels on the
walls made no alarms. The next day the extemporized
scouting parties reported no hostile movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
But it was certain that the authorities at Jerusalem
would not long delay a blow which would vindicate
their power, and the honor of the monarch.</p>

<p>In the little town all was confusion, for the inhabitants
made preparations to migrate from their
now insecure homes. The excitement increased as
from the hills and valleys around their herdsmen
hastily gathered the flocks, and drove them close to
the city.</p>

<p>On the second night strange sounds floated everywhere
through the darkness&mdash;the lowing of cattle,
bleating of sheep, braying of asses, and the occasional
grunt of camels resenting the unseemly hour
of their lading. These moved eastward through the
darkness, and later were followed by an exodus of
the inhabitants from the town. Deborah noted the
women, whose hands had scarcely lifted heavier
weight than the distaff, now bowed beneath bulky
loads of household stuff. Boys carried jars of provisions
as big as themselves. Men, armed with
swords, javelins, bows, and bludgeons, led the way,
or deployed as guards on flank and rear of the unsteady
column.</p>

<p>In the confusion little notice was taken of Deborah
and Caleb, except as some one peered into their
faces in the endeavor to identify them. They
trudged along with a group of women and children,
old men and cripples, whose slow pace excited impatience
and an occasional unkind taunt from the
stronger limbed.</p>

<p>In the company with Caleb hobbled a lad some
years older than he. The feet of this boy were
strangely malformed. Both were so twisted from
their normal relation to his legs that his toes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
pointed very nearly backward. This infirmity and
the weight of his heavy wooden sandals were, however,
largely compensated for by the boy's muscular
strength and alertness of faculty. With the aid of a
stick, crotched at the upper end, he swung himself
along the road and over obstacles in the fields
which tangled legs better than his own. Only by
the harsh words and cuffs of the men who were
leading or guarding the multitude was the boy
kept with the weaker folk. Now some sentinel, with
hand to ear, pausing, and listening for the remotest
sound of approaching soldiery, was startled by the
rattling of the stones under the boy's feet and
crutch. Now, again, he was hobbling along with
the rear guard as valiantly as if his stick were the
sword of Goliath of Gath.</p>

<p>Through the dim night the lame lad noticed that
Caleb's gait was different from that of the others.
His occasional stumbling and his clinging to his
sister's hand excited the curiosity of his observer.</p>

<p>"Say, are you lame, too?" the strange boy asked.</p>

<p>"No, I am only blind, the Lord be praised!" replied
Caleb.</p>

<p>"Only blind! Whew!" and a long whistle threaded
the stillness of the march.</p>

<p>"Silence!" said a gruff voice.</p>

<p>"Can't you see a bit?"</p>

<p>"No, not as you see."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any eyes?" and the boy drew
Caleb's face close to his. "Oh, such big eyes! and
can't see? But such eyes must see somewhere.
Maybe they are like my feet, that look in the direction
they aren't going. Can't you see the inside of
your head?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Caleb laughed, and fell in with the mirthful mood
of his companion.</p>

<p>"They say I can see out of my ears and from my
finger ends."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," replied the lame boy. "And
can you see as well in the dark as in the light?"</p>

<p>"Just as well."</p>

<p>"Whew!"</p>

<p>"Silence there!"</p>

<p>"Say, couldn't you and I have fun with the
jackals?"</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Say, can you see"&mdash;and the boy's voice sunk to
a whisper&mdash;"can you see God? Or maybe the angels?
What are they like? Like Judas? or old Mattathias?
or like&mdash;like your sister there?"</p>

<p>Caleb protested against his companion's irreverence
and ignorance.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, the angels see you."</p>

<p>"How do you know they do?"</p>

<p>"Because, blind as you are, you do not stumble
half as much as I do. There, you stepped right over
that rock that I nearly broke my heels on; and the
Psalmist said of somebody, 'that the angels keep
him from stubbing his toes.' Those are not the
words, but something like them. But how can the
angels lift you over the stones if they can't see you?
Eh! But what's your name?"</p>

<p>"Caleb. What's yours?"</p>

<p>"Solomon; but they don't call me that. They call
me Mephibosheth, because Mephibosheth was lame
in his feet; that is, they call me Meph because the
whole word takes too much breath, and folks need
all they've got, especially in such travelling as this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The night wore wearily away. Once old Mattathias
joined the little group, but only for a few
moments; for though the conduct of the expedition
was left to the younger men, chiefly his five sons, the
responsibility of the movement rested with the
venerable priest. Once Judas came to them, but it
was only to insist that the daughter of Elkiah
should make use of a rude palanquin, which two
strong-limbed men carried between them upon two
poles. This Deborah refused, and, footsore and
weary though she was, trudged by its side while the
bearers conveyed a sick woman with her babe at
her breast.</p>

<p>In the early dawn the fugitives threaded the wild,
narrow ravine in the neighborhood of Michmash,
once the scene of the adventures of Prince Jonathan,
during the wars of Saul against the Philistines. As
the day advanced, women and children sought rest
and shelter among the caverns and chasms which
made that region frightful in days of peace, but a
welcome retreat to those whom the troublous times
had ejected from better homes. Here, at Judas'
advice, Mattathias decided to halt the little host.
All fell to work building the defenses which they
would surely need in coming dangers, and which
became ever after famous as the eyrie whence the
Maccabæan eagles, those sons of Mattathias,
swooped down upon the Syrian prey.</p>

<p>Rapidly the natural rocks grew into an orderly
fortification. Loose stone walls were built between
the outcropping ledges, until a vast space was enclosed
and divided into compartments, where a few
defenders could withstand many assailants, and to
capture which would be for the victors to fasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
themselves into slaughter pens. Across the top of
the natural chasms were laid poles covered with
brushwood, which screened the people from the sun
by day and from the dews by night. Great boulders
scattered over the adjacent fields were connected by
ditches, which were so roofed that, while they
effectually obscured those passing beneath, they
were at the same time pitfalls for any intruders.
Each great rock thus became an outlying fortress,
behind which, day and night, lay wary men.</p>

<p>At one place was a rude forge, where all sorts of
iron implements were wrought into weapons; reversing
the ancient prediction, for plowshares were now
beaten into swords, and pruning-hooks into spears.</p>

<p>Day by day even the women and children were
practised in archery, and learned to hurl the javelin
and sling stones; while the men were drilled in companies
to execute man&oelig;uvres which the genius of
Judas devised, and which were especially adapted to
warfare in the craggy battlements of the hills. Far
and wide scouts answered one another with mysterious
signals, quick flashes at night, and sounds by
day in which the cries of birds and beasts were
imitated according to a code prepared by Jonathan.
The country for leagues about was thus practically
under one eye and one voice of command.</p>

<p>One evening Judas came to the little enclosure of
rocks which the respect and sympathy of the people
had assigned to the privacy of Deborah. It was
screened by a coarse matting, which served both as
door and wall.</p>

<p>"This is no place for the daughter of Elkiah," said
the young man. "I have come to ask that you
allow half a score of our brave men to escort you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a spot of more safety and comfort. The strong
castle of Masada, in the wilderness by the Sea of
Salt, will prove impregnable to any attack. The
journey will not be more difficult than remaining
here."</p>

<p>Deborah expressed her gratitude. She looked at
the upturned face of Caleb. It was pale and emaciate
with fatigue and exposure.</p>

<p>"Surely, this is no place for the lad," she said, as
she held his cheeks between her hands.</p>

<p>"As soon as the shadows darken the ravine yonder
you will start?" inquired Judas.</p>

<p>Deborah for a moment made no response. She
gazed upon the women and children about her.</p>

<p>"And these?"</p>

<p>"They must remain where they are, and share the
fortunes of the men. It would be unsafe to move
so many. Besides, the castle is a little one, and
would not hold them. But you, if I mistake not,
as the daughter of Elkiah, have claims of kinship
with Ben Aaron, who occupies Masada."</p>

<p>Deborah sought the sky as if in prayer; then she
said:</p>

<p>"Judas, call me no longer the daughter of Elkiah.
Call me now only one of the daughters of Israel.
Why should I flee to the castle when these, as worthy
as I, have no such refuge?"</p>

<p>"But surely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, do not entreat me. Tell me, Judas, have
you not a vow to live or die in defense of Israel?"</p>

<p>"Truly, as God lives!" said he, raising his right
hand.</p>

<p>"Would you break your vow? Nay, do not answer.
And I, too, have a vow&mdash;to die if God will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
take the sacrifice, with His people. Here I can serve,
if not with those who fight, then with those who
watch and care for the helpless. Take the lad, but
here I must stay."</p>

<p>Caleb, who had been a listener, now uttered a
cry such as never escaped him except when in some
agony of pain. He flung himself into his sister's
arms. No word passed between them, but there is
a converse of hearts that needs no speech. She loosened
his embrace.</p>

<p>"It is His will. My child, we shall not be separated.
We will both stay."</p>

<p>Scarcely had she said this when cries of alarm
rose without. Judas was instantly gone.</p>

<p>In an hour came Meph, utterly winded with his
haste, but he managed with detached mouthfuls of
breath to give the report of a wonderful encounter
with the enemy. He declared that&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Greeks came along&mdash;a whole army of them&mdash;marching
as stiff as a grove of palm-trees&mdash;shields
on one shoulder and pikes on the other. All of a
sudden whiz! whiz! whiz!&mdash;and they dropped in
their tracks&mdash;lots of them did&mdash;as if they were bulrushes.
The rest of them closed up, and put their
shields together like a tent; but rocks came down
on them like hailstones&mdash;and they broke and ran
like hares."</p>

<p>With his crutch Meph mapped on the ground the
plan of the battle, and then appealed to Caleb to
predict that such a magnificent victory would be
the end of the war. "The sword of the Lord and of
Gideon is with us! The sword of the Lord and of
Judas!" and he whirled his crutch in pantomimic
extermination of the foe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>But, alas, such engagements were to be the almost
daily experience of the patriots. The Greek
bands were worsted by the intense bravery of the
Jews, and the more shrewdly laid plans of their
untrained but heaven-gifted leaders. In resisting
these forays, and in their devoted care of the threatened
people, the five sons of Mattathias won the
titles which history has added to their names&mdash;John,
the <i>Good</i>; Simon, the <i>Wise</i>; Judas, the <i>Hammerer</i>;
Eleazar, the <i>Sunburst</i>; and Jonathan, the
<i>Crafty</i>.</p>

<p>The incessant excitement wrapt the popular mind
with a frenzy of religious enthusiasm and credulity.
Much of the time was spent in prayer and song.
The devoted people saw in the skill of their earthly
champions only a fuller measure of that Divine
Spirit whose impulse gave wisdom and valor, and
whose invisible Presence was a surer defense than
ten thousand phalanges of shields. As in the days
of Elijah, so once more ardent souls saw, as Deborah
had done, "the chariots of Israel and the horses
thereof" in the embattled clouds at sunset and sunrise;
and God in armor strode among the spectres of
the night.</p>

<p>In such experiences, in which mental exaltation
put on physical prowess, and the spiritual world
was inwoven with the material&mdash;as we may believe
the soul is knit with the body&mdash;passed a year in the
"Fortress of the Rocks."</p>

<h2>XIII<br />

<span class="smaller">DAUGHTER OF THE VOICE</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">To</span> Deborah this was a year of mighty
transformation. The traces of girlhood
were worn from her face by the hardness
of her daily life. Her sparkling
eyes deepened and steadied their fire.
Her features became more immobile and rigid under
the stress of her one persistent thought and purpose.
Even her body was changed. She was taller.
The rounded contour of her form became more masculinely
muscular. The graceful carriage of the
maiden, brought up in the elegance of Elkiah's
home, was somewhat lost in the heavier tread and
more angular movement developed by bearing burdens
with her humbler sisters in the rude encampment,
and even by training at arms with the men.</p>

<p>Yet, if less fair and maidenly, she was more nobly
beautiful than ever before. Could Dion have seen
her, he would have thought her more like Athena
than when he first saw her at Elkiah's gate. Hers
was now a head for a helmet rather than for ornaments.
Armor would have fitted her figure as well
as robes.</p>

<p>To her people she had become the incarnation of
patriotism. They gave her the sacred appellation,
"The daughter of Jerusalem," the name by which
the ancient prophets had designated the nation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Even old Mattathias gazed upon her as if to take
from her face some sign of that diviner will he
prayed daily to know. To the maiden's words he
would listen as to the counsel of his battle-trained
advisers.</p>

<p>On one subject, however, the venerable leader was
inexorably opposed to her wishes. She asked that
she might be permitted to wear the armor of the
soldier, and join in the battles. The old priest replied
in the words of the ancient law:</p>

<p>"The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth
unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's
garment, for all that so do are an abomination
unto the Lord thy God."</p>

<p>To this prohibition he was led to make one conditional
exception&mdash;that in the event of the Fort of
the Rocks being taken by the enemy, any disguise
which might enable her to escape the danger peculiar
to a captured woman might be used.</p>

<p>"If," replied Deborah, "for the safety of one woman
the letter of the law may be set aside, why not for
the safety of Israel?"</p>

<p>"You are right, my daughter. Should Israel need
you, robe yourself as you will, yet remember it will
be as when a victim is arrayed for the sacrifice.
But with our brave men about you surely there is
no need for you to mingle in the common fray.
Your womanly presence now encourages us more
than a band of swordsmen."</p>

<p>"But if&mdash;if"&mdash;Deborah hesitated in speaking&mdash;"but
if the Voice should bid me?"</p>

<p>"The Voice! The Voice!"</p>

<p>Mattathias bowed his head upon his breast. "The
Bath-kol! The daughter of God's voice! I may not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
dispute that Monitor; for only those anointed of
heaven can hear it."</p>

<p>"How may one know the Voice? Explain to me
the sacred Bath-kol"&mdash;and Deborah leaned forward,
her hand upon the patriarch's knee and her face upturned
toward his in reverent and eager inquiry.</p>

<p>Mattathias put his hand upon her forehead.
"Alas!" he said, "I fear that the Voice has not been
heard by any in our generation, for the days are
too full of evil. God's voice is wordless; or rather,
shall I say, the Eternal Word is voiceless. The
Divine Mind shines through the mind of man as the
lightning through the clouds. But since Malachi
fell asleep, no soul of man has been so pure that
it could transmit the heavenly glory and interpret
its meaning.</p>

<p>"Yet," he continued, after a pause, "it may be
that the Lord still teaches His own by indirection,
by what we call the Daughter of the Voice; the echo
of the heavenly from earthly things. Some of our
wisest rabbis have held that, after one has prayed,
the first words that fall upon the ear, especially if
they be sacred words from the Law, the Prophets, or
the Psalms, may be such echoes of the Divine Will.
But in these matters I am unskilled. I only know
that if God may not speak to a soul so true as
thine, beaten pure by affliction, as the oil is beaten
for the lamps of the sanctuary, then, indeed, are we
left without the light."</p>

<p>Such words confirmed a conviction already
vaguely felt by Deborah. She recalled her tremendous
emotion that night amid the ruins of the house
of Ben Isaac. She knew nothing of those psychological
laws by which she might have accounted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
her experience without attributing it to Divine suggestion.
She had often observed how the atmosphere,
hot above the fire, becomes hazy and tremulous,
so that objects seen through it are distorted;
but she did not know that her overheated mind
might render it just as uncertain a medium for
thoughts.</p>

<p>A few days after her conversation with Mattathias,
the venerable man, shaken by age, and by the
strain of duties that would have broken the energy of
the youngest and strongest, laid himself down to die.</p>

<p>Earth has witnessed few scenes so humanly sublime
as that in the rock-formed chamber, where the
priest and warrior committed his work to his children,
and his soul to God.</p>

<p>His sons knelt around the couch. To them he gave
special counsel, correcting the weakness or encouraging
the peculiar strength which his prophetic soul
saw in each. For Jonathan he invoked caution;
for Simon, courage; for all, faith in the Presence of
the Lord, "who," said he, "will surely appear for
our deliverance. But by whose arm will He smite?
I know not. And yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked long upon Judas. He put his thin
hands upon his son's head. Then his own uplifted
face became strangely luminous&mdash;doubtless as once
was that of Moses. His lips parted as if they were
burdened with some glorious prophecy; but they
uttered no further word. There issued from them
only&mdash;his soul.</p>

<p>They laid the body of Mattathias back upon the
couch. A light seemed for a while to glow about his
head, and then to be absorbed into the marble
whiteness of his features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Never was funeral cortege of warrior or monarch
more impressive than that which wound among the
hills far away to Modin, watched by hostile eyes,
and guarded by the sharp swords of a band of
patriots who determined that their dead chieftain
should not be deprived of burial in the sepulchre of
his fathers. The mournful train was accompanied
for a short distance from the Fort of the Rocks by
the entire multitude of women and children, wailing
with low outcries, rending their garments, and flinging
handfuls of dust into the air until the armed
procession was out of sight.</p>

<p>The soul of Deborah had been too mightily stirred
by these occurrences to allow her to speak much
with her people. A deep ravine hard by became
sacred to her as a place of meditation. There
was something in the very formation of this place
that helped her thought. An enormous rock projected
many feet from a precipitous palisade, and
overhung the narrow width of the ravine. It seemed
about to fall and crush her as she sat beneath it.
Yet she knew that it could not fall, for the mass of
visible stone was more than counterbalanced by a
larger proportion of the rock imbedded out of sight,
in the hillside.</p>

<p>"So," she said, "I am always under impending
danger. A black shadow is always on my soul.
But I can trust the unknown goodness of the Lord,
which outweighs and prevents the threatening evil!"</p>

<p>There, as in her sanctuary, she one day sat down
to think and pray. How wearied she was with her
woman's work in the camp! Had there been about
her the duties and affections of a home, it would
have been different; for she was made to love, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
love intensely. What a wealth of devotion she
poured upon her blind brother! Yet his care did not
furnish sufficient diversion for her excited brain and
heart.</p>

<p>The form of her father was, alas! now only a
memory. It was always with her; but it drained
her soul, as the dry desert drinks up the streams
that come from the mountains, and yet remains a
desert, flowerless, fountainless.</p>

<p>Her brother Benjamin? Ah, it is hard to love
where we do not respect; and while she would have
given her life for his had emergency required, the
thought of him made her more lonely, since even
brotherhood was soiled with impiety and treason.</p>

<p>If Dion's friendship now and then flashed a pleasing
thought through her mind, it was only like a
warm glow in the dark cloud of her prevailing
mood, and as quickly gone. Yet she was startled
when she noted how frequently that brightness
shot through the cloud; and she put herself under
inner penance after each recollection of the noble-hearted
Greek. Indeed, she tried to hate him for
his offered love. It seemed incongruous, hypocritical,
for a Greek to be so generous and good. A
Greek! Her soul tortured itself with detestation
of that whole racial type; yet somehow the man
persisted in standing out from his race, as a vein
of gold gleaming from its bed of baser earth. By
strong effort she drove his image from her imagination.
It was not probable that they would meet
again; and if they did, he would see now no helpless
girl appealing to his pity, but a woman, strong
and vengeful, whose words would provoke his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
hatred of her as the embodiment of her hated
people.</p>

<p>So, as she had said, her heart was empty&mdash;empty
of all things that ought to furnish a woman's nature.
She seemed to herself an unsexed soul, a mass
of reckless, excited energy which could find repose
only in outward action. Oh, to be a man, strong
of arm, as tireless as daring! She looked with contempt
upon her feminine attire, which she thought
no longer fitted her changed nature.</p>

<p>If she might not march in the ranks of the
soldiers, why could she not engage in the secret
service of which she had heard Jonathan, the Crafty,
speak as necessary to their defense? She might act
as a spy. The little band of patriots could not
hope to hold out ultimately against the overwhelming
numbers that Antiochus would send, unless
their valor were seconded by deep plotting.</p>

<p>To act the part she contemplated would require
her to assume various attire. Would not heaven
grant her dispensation from the letter of the law
that made it a shame for a woman to put on a
man's apparel?</p>

<p>Such thoughts surged through her soul as she sat
in the ravine. At length she knelt and consecrated
herself again&mdash;as she had done a hundred times&mdash;to
her people's God. With mute lips and phraseless
purpose she waited upon the Lord to know His
will. Oh, for some assurance that it was right to
follow her own intent!</p>

<p>The silence was for a time unbroken. At length
a strange sound smote upon the ear. It was like
nothing she had ever heard&mdash;a ringing note that
seemed to come from the ground. Now another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of different tone; and another still. These sounds
were repeated in an order that suggested the notes
of the music with which the players on instruments
at the Temple accompanied the chanting of the familiar
hymn:</p>

<p>"Awake! Awake, Deborah! Awake! Awake! utter
a song!"</p>

<p>Neither harp, nor lute, nor tabret, nor cymbal
could have produced these sounds. It was as if
the rocks themselves had become mighty timbrels,
and were stricken by some spirit of the woods.
Surely this must be of superhuman agency: the
noise was so unearthly, and the notes so clearly
belonged to the words they suggested. It was not
a voice; yet surely it was the Bath-kol, the Echo,
the Daughter of the Voice, of which the now sainted
Mattathias had spoken.</p>

<p>She prostrated herself among the gnarled roots
of a great terebinth that projected from the side of
the ravine as if they were the horns of an altar.
So, too, her soul clung to her Lord. She prayed
in words that His will might be her will. Perhaps
in thought she prayed that her will might be His
will&mdash;a distinction she was too unskilled in moral
anatomy to note.</p>

<p>Again and again with ecstatic fervor she murmured
her oft-repeated vow, "Lo, I come to do Thy
will, O God!" She lay some moments in almost a
trance of seraphic peace. This was changed to seraphic
fury. Jehovah had accepted her. She was
to be His messenger&mdash;a messenger of fire, of dagger,
of deceit toward Israel's foes, as well as of consolation
to His people.</p>

<p>She rose, and stood with hands clasped behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
her, her face upturned to the glowing line of light
that spanned the ravine. She drank in the brightness
as heaven's approbation.</p>

<p>How long she remained in that attitude of rhapsody
she did not know. The spell was suddenly
broken.</p>

<p>"There she is! Here, Caleb, is Deborah! Give me
your hand, or she will be gone ere we reach her,"
cried Mephibosheth to his blind friend, as, spying
Deborah at a distance, the children tried to reach
her. But thus startled, she walked too fast for the
lame boy, encumbered as he was with the care of
his comrade.</p>

<p>"Well, let her go. It is enough that she is safe,"
said Caleb.</p>

<p>The boys had spent an hour in a favorite haunt
in a field of great boulders that lay just at the
brink of the ravine. These stones were of volcanic
origin, and a proportion of metal had entered into
their composition. The lads soon found that when
they were struck with smaller stones they emitted
semi-musical sounds, and they were not long in
playing upon them crude imitations of the tunes
with which they were familiar. Caleb would sit
by one that gave a deep ring, while Meph with a
stone and his crutch could reach two others.</p>

<p>"I thought when we played 'Awake, Deborah!'
we would start her," said Meph.</p>

<p>"So we did," replied Caleb, and reaching his hands
up to his comrade's shoulders, with a spring and a
boost, he was instantly astride them, a saddle that
the good-natured cripple had often provided for his
more unfortunate friend when the way was rough.</p>

<p>In the counsel of the Fort of the Rocks Deborah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
that night related to Judas, Simon and Jonathan
the story of the strange sounds she had heard in
the ravine.</p>

<p>Simon shook his head and remained silent, glancing
solicitously at the girl, as a physician might
study one suspected of dementia. Judas quickly
avowed his belief that God was again speaking to
His people as in the ancient days of faith. The after
debate between these brothers was decided by the
words of Jonathan, the Crafty.</p>

<p>"If," said Jonathan, "Simon be right in ascribing
this to the maiden's madness, still it does not follow
that Judas is wholly wrong. Does not the Lord
use even our dreams, when our minds are astray
from their waking wisdom? If He made the ass to
correct the prophet, why should He not use the
vagary of this most pious woman? We need such
service as she proposes. My voice is that we put
no restraint upon her becoming our spy, lest peradventure
we be found to fight against the will of
Him who, it may be, is impelling her to this duty."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> vale of Shechem is the fairest in
Palestine. It is a long strip of meadow
scarcely two hundred yards wide,
guarded, as by two sleeping giants, by
the mountains of Ebal and Gerizim,
which cut the sky between two and three thousand
feet above. For four furlongs of its length the valley
lies like an emerald, broken by silver streams and
sparkling basins of water. Beyond, for an equal distance,
the bright green gives place to the gray foliage
of olive groves, until the natural glory fades into the
staring white houses of the town. In shady nooks
and sunny glades the earth bursts with flowers of
every hue, as if Flora had danced and left her fabled
footprints impregnate with germs of beauty. If one
be sated with the fairness that lies at one's feet, let
the eyes rest upon the terraces of olive and grape,
fig and prickly pear which relieve the precipitous
sides of Ebal, the ancient Mountain of Cursing; or
upon the swelling domes of rock which make the
impressive mass of Gerizim, the Mountain of Blessing.</p>

<p>Even Apollonius, the desecrator of Jerusalem, with
his eyes dimmed with the rheum of many debauches,
must have delighted in the prospect; for midway the
vale rose his gorgeous pavilion. From its door,
when not enamored of nature, he could feast his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
pride upon the white and blue tents of his army,
which gleamed far up the slopes of either mountain.
In reward for his service in desolating the Jewish
capital, and in many ways acting as a sort of procurer
for the pride, greed, and lust of his royal
master, Epiphanes had made Apollonius Governor of
Samaria, and commander of all the king's forces
in Syria.</p>

<p>Into his camp at Shechem had come not only
brave warriors, but many merchants, to purchase
the prospective spoil of the invaders. Women, too,
some the wives of officers, others adventuresses,
flaunted their gay attire amid the flashing helmets
and spears of the soldiery.</p>

<p>Before the great General's pavilion stood his steed,
a gigantic charger, with arching neck and restive
eyes, now sniffing the hand of his groom, and anon
rearing as if to break from his custody. Near by
was a heavy-wheeled, but light-bodied chariot, its
seat cushioned in creamy silk. At its pole waited a
span of graceful roans, glittering in harness buckled
and bossed with gold.</p>

<p>At the opening of the tent sat Apollonius, in full
armor, except that his head was bared. Upon a
couch just within reclined a woman. At a glance
one would have said that she was of great beauty.
Her features failed perhaps of the finest proportions
that mark the classic Greek face; the nostrils too
distended; the mouth too large; forehead high, but
masked with abundant auburn locks, which were
braided down almost to the eyebrows. Chiselled in
marble that face would not have been an Aphrodite;
but flushed as it was at the moment with excitement,
her eyes sparkling with latent coquetry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
her slightly parted lips curved with a sensuous suggestion,
she was sufficiently fascinating to the degenerate
taste of the Greek officers passing the tent,
who stole not unwelcome glimpses at her fairness.</p>

<p>"And what, pray, my lord Apollonius, is to be my
portion of the spoil you are to take? I have no
taste for the blood of the Jews, which you say your
sword will draw from these Maccabæan peasants.
A draught of wine&mdash;if only the cup were golden and
I might keep it&mdash;would please me better. But no
golden cups and no goodly garments will you get
from these beggarly people. Some clouts and a few
of the sickles they use for swords will scarcely grace
the victory of one whom the king has honored for
his valor."</p>

<p>"I see," replied the General, "that my fair one has
grown weary of her lord, and that I need to freshly
bribe her favor. Will not the gift of yesterday
suffice to keep my Helena's patience for a day or
two to come?"</p>

<p>The General toyed with a silver serpent with eyes
of ruby, which encircled her arm. After a moment's
pause, watching closely his companion as if studying
the effect of his words, he added:</p>

<p>"If the trumpery of Jewish housewives please you
not, there is better spoil in Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"Is anything left there?" languidly asked the
woman, looking at her shapely wrist and hand.</p>

<p>"Much. And it is game that will give zest to the
catching. Listen! Since my fair goddess has tired
of me, I propose that she shall find another lover
more to her liking."</p>

<p>The woman's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>Apollonius continued: "You know, that by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
ruling of the King, the rich estates of Elkiah are
not to be sequestered as other property of the
rebels. His son, Glaucon, having become a Greek, is
recognized as the heir. A handsome fellow he is,
with a thimbleful of brains; conceited, a prey to
clever men, an easier victim of a clever woman&mdash;such
a woman as has charmed an old soldier like
me, caring as you know but little for the sex. You
need but smile at Glaucon to addle his wits."</p>

<p>"Are your wits addled?" queried the woman contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they have been, but I am in fair way to
recover, as my scheme will prove. Should you marry
this Glaucon, by Greek law it is true you would
not inherit his estates; but no law prevents the fool
from giving to you whatever you ask as the price
of your favor; and you come high at times, as my
thin belt can attest. But, my dear, you must appear
to him as of princely rank, for the fellow has
been flattered to believe himself courted by the very
household of the King. I think I can make my letters
sufficiently ennoble you, if your beauty does not
evidence your divinity. Will not this sound well?
Ahem! 'The Princess Helena, cousin to Apollonius!'
Ah, you blush at the title. Glaucon will pay me
well for persuading your Olympian wings to fold
themselves on his dungheap. It is a scheme worthy
the Jew himself, is it not? This little finger of yours
will pick the lock of Glaucon's treasure-house."</p>

<p>The woman laughed outright as she cried:</p>

<p>"Shall I go to Jerusalem and act the prude? That
is an art I have never practised. I surely had never
won your love, my venerable Apollo, if I had posed
as the chaste Artemis."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps not," replied the General, with a shrug
of his shoulders, "but you have acted the chaste
goddess perfectly in the eyes of others. That I will
say; for I have had less than a score of opportunities
for jealousy during as many moons. And I will
swear to this Glaucon that I caught you in my arms
as you once escaped the Grotto of Pan at Ephesus."</p>

<p>"Grotto of Pan? Another remembrance of your
nursery; and with a moral, I doubt not, as good as
one of Æsop. Let me hear the story, but leave off
the lesson," replied she, lolling languidly upon the
couch.</p>

<p>"Why," said Apollonius, "at Ephesus, when a
woman's virtue is not transparent, they bring her
to Pan's Grotto for testing. If the god sees no
offense in her, then the doors open to heavenly
music, and she escapes. Looking one day for something
in the shape of womanhood that was immaculate,
I lingered by the entrance, and you came
bouncing out. Glaucon is up in our Greek legends,
and will understand me, even if you did not."</p>

<p>"But if the woman could not pass inspection?" his
companion asked nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Well, in such an unusual case for the town of
Ephesus, where Artemis has her temple, the pipes in
Pan's cave screech out a wail for the damned, and
the tainted woman drops through the rock floor
into the river Styx. I will swear that I did not fish
you out of the river Styx."</p>

<p>"Paugh!" sneered the woman. "It is time that
you sold me out to another after that speech."</p>

<p>The tears shot into her eyes, but they were quickly
dried by her hot rage; and as quickly again the
livid fury gave place to a forced smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"I warn you, my lord, that I myself will be the
judge of my new purchaser, as I was of you."</p>

<p>This woman was well aware that anger did not
become her type of countenance; it changed her
beauty into hideousness. Whatever age-marks were
latent in her face, smoothed by practised smiles, or
masked by cosmetics, were brought out by ill temper&mdash;as
sunburn develops freckles. She was as self-conscious
when gazed at by others as when she was
alone before her mirror, and as ready with her arts.
She, therefore, instantly suppressed the rising displeasure.</p>

<p>Indeed, the displeasure would itself have died as
Apollonius further disclosed his schemes; for any
fondness she may have felt for the present owner of
her affections was less than her innate cupidity, and
less than that passion for intrigue and adventure
which she had developed by much practice on many
fields. In her, deceitfulness reached the rank which
in men is called diplomacy. Though now at home
in the tent of the Syrian commander, she was not
unwilling to enlarge the sphere of her conquest in
any direction. Perhaps her eagerness for the spoil
of such a house as that of Glaucon was as laudable,
certainly as natural, as Apollonius' own ambition to
fame himself as the conqueror of Palestine.</p>

<p>The conversation of the General and the woman
was interrupted by a lad, whose basket of fruit,
deftly balanced on his head, had gained him admission
to the camp; for while strict guard was
kept against the intrusion of peasant men and
women, the children were allowed freedom to sell
their delicacies for the coins, though often they received
only the cuffs, of the soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy was stretched at full length upon the
ground, counting the bits of money he had taken,
and sorting the figs, dates, and grapes which were
left in his basket. His head was covered with a mass
of unkempt black hair, his body with a single garment,
which might have been an inverted corn sack,
tied with a string at the waist, while his head protruded
through a hole in the bottom. His legs and
feet were bare except for the dirt which hosed
them, and striped with scratches made by bramble
bushes.</p>

<p>So engrossed was the boy in his business calculations
that he did not seem aware of his undue
proximity to the General's tent, until a sentinel
prodded him in the calf of the leg with his spear-point,
and bade him "Begone!"</p>

<p>The General, looking up at the outcry, recalled
the lad and bought of his fruit, tossing some of it
into the lap of his companion.</p>

<p>"Faugh! The Jew's filth soils them," cried she,
as the clusters were laid upon the rug.</p>

<p>"Let them be well cleansed then," said the General;
"but in this country we must be less particular.
The Jews believe that Adam, their first father,
was made out of the ground, and surely the race
seems fond of its original stock. But in one respect
the Jews are cleaner than most people; vermin
cannot abide their vile blood; it poisons even the
fleas."</p>

<p>"The lad is finely formed," said the woman, eyeing
him as a connoisseur. "His ankles are trim enough
for a girl's, and his feet are not flattened and ill-shapen
as those of most peasants are. And what
a face! Ganymedes was not fairer. Look out, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
lad, that the eagle does not fly away with you
and make you cup-bearer to the gods."</p>

<p>"Why not make him your own Ganymedes, my
divinity?" cried the General. "You have no Hebe
of your own begetting to be jealous of him. What
say you, my lad, would you like to be dressed in
spangles and wait at the hand of the fairest of
Astartes? And perhaps, being only a child, you
might drink at her lips, since my goddess has lost
her liking for an old soldier's kisses."</p>

<p>With a look of stupid inquiry the boy replied in
the Samaritan patois, "An as for a bunch; three
bunches for two ases; all for an obolo. Give me
drachma and I bring you so much"&mdash;extending his
arms as if to enclose a bushel.</p>

<p>The Greeks burst into laughter.</p>

<p>"Your learned wit is wasted on a Samaritan, as
I am afraid mine would be on that Jerusalem Jew,"
said the mistress.</p>

<p>"It will not be wasted there. Glaucon speaks
Greek well, as do all the better sort in the city.
Besides, his head is just now as full as a pedlar's
pack of all the scraps of our philosophy, poetry,
and art that he can hear. He is specially interested
in our Greek goddesses, and in making his hair curl.
With his head in your lap you can arrange his locks
and give him a lesson in the worship of Aphrodite
at the same time. Glaucon will be as good a pupil
of Helena as Pericles was of Aspasia."</p>

<p>The fruit-seller, impervious to their wit at his expense,
gathered up the remnant of his wares, and
started away; but quickly turning, he threw himself
down upon his belly in the shadow of the tent,
and resumed counting his coins, tallying each one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with a jerk of his heels, as those dirty but graceful
appendages waved over his back.</p>

<p>"The boy's legs talk as freely as the arms and face
of Pharetes, the pantomimist. He would make an
actor, if trained," observed Apollonius.</p>

<p>"Or a dancer," replied the woman. "Let us see
if he has learned to wiggle his calves rhythmically."</p>

<p>She sang a rollicking run of notes, accompanied
with snapping her fingers and waving her arms,
which tempted even Apollonius to give a few steps
in his jingling armor. The boy only stared and
grinned.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said the General, "the religion of these
people is so dull that it rusts even their sinews.
A Greek child would have danced on his hands and
head at such singing. But, my dear, you should
start to-morrow for Jerusalem. I will strike the
miserable spawn of that priest Mattathias&mdash;Apollo,
my namesake, being willing&mdash;within three days.
Some ten thousand of us, each as valiant as Alexander
himself, are only waiting to conquer these
sand-hills in lieu of a larger world. We will drive
the Jews into their holes and drown them in their
own blood, and then move to the city. I fear that
Menelaos, the High Priest, is scraping the bottom
of every strong-box the Jews left, and if we do not
hasten there will not be an obolo for us to buy
grapes with."</p>

<p>His companion had become curiously interested
in the lad.</p>

<p>"Do the boys and girls dress alike in this country?"
she asked. "That child has the hips and
shoulders of a woman."</p>

<p>The boy had evidently completed his bookkeeping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and hastily swallowing some of his wares, moved
away. He sauntered awhile in the direction of the
town, trying to keep two figs at a time in the air
or to catch one in his mouth; then suddenly turned
southward toward the eastern slope of Mount Gerizim,
and, depositing his basket under a clump of
bushes, ran southward as fast as his legs could
carry him.</p>

<h2>XV<br />

<span class="smaller">THE BATTLE OF THE WADY</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> gray light of the following morning,
breaking between the cliffs of Moab, revealed
two figures not far from the
Fort of the Rocks.</p>

<p>One was the stalwart form of Judas,
his red hair glowing like a sunrise on a mountain
pinnacle as compared with the tiny body of his companion,
the lame Mephibosheth. The boy's strength
was utterly exhausted, so that he could scarcely
stand with the aid of his crutch; but his tongue,
as usual, was "like a strong man rejoicing to run
a race."</p>

<p>"Up on my shoulder, Meph!" said Judas. "You
can better whisper in my ear what I judge it were
not well for even the trees to hear. She was unharmed?
And you met her in the Wady? That is
a good seven hours from here, Meph. And you have
trudged all night to bring me tidings? The Lord
bless you!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" responded Meph. "And General Apollonius
moves at once upon us. He will attack us to-morrow
or next day. Deborah bade me say that
he would surely come by the Wady. They must
move up the dry water-bed if they would reach us
so soon, for it will take thrice the hours to march
over the hills; and she says that one man on the
cliff above is worth a score hemmed in by the walls
of the great chasm they must pass through."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"God be praised! And is this all?" asked Judas.</p>

<p>"Except," added Meph, "that a rich convoy has
already started from Shechem for Jerusalem by the
direct road. In it are many merchants and women
of rank."</p>

<p>"We want neither their pelf nor their women,"
said Judas. "Let them go their way, if they only
keep out of ours. But this Apollonius I would have.
He is the biggest hawk of them all. Oh, Meph!
Meph! if we could only get his claws tangled in
the Wady as you get the birds fastened in your
nets!"</p>

<p>"I generally have to pull the string myself," said
the boy. "You must pull just then and just so, but
you get them."</p>

<p>Judas laughed and assured Meph that he would
make a strategist if not a champion some day; and
with gigantic strides he went over the hills.</p>

<p>Within an hour the Fort of the Rocks was deserted
by all save the women, the aged, the sick, and children.
In single bands the armed men moved northward,
following the depression between the hills,
filing like ants close to the clumps of rock so that
no eye less sharp than an eagle's would have detected
a moving army. As night fell, the Jews, who
had been scattered during the daylight, gathered in
among the rocks bordering the great Wady. In the
darkness they felt their way each to such couch as
he might find between the boulders. Soon all was
silent, except for the coming and going of Judas
and his brethren, giving encouragement or command.</p>

<p>At the same time the army of Apollonius was
approaching, a league to the west. A squadron of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
horsemen led the van. These followed the roadway,
whose white line was extinguished by the clouds of
dust raised by thousands of hoofs. Lance-point and
helmet gleamed dimly through the darkness answering
the stars, as when heavenly bodies are reflected
in rippling water. The command to move
in silence did not prevent the clicking of weapons
and the low rumble of horses' feet on the beaten
road.</p>

<p>Foot soldiers, armed with pikes, bows, and swords,
followed the horsemen. Then came camels and asses,
laden with provisions and heavier weapons. To the
rear struggled hundreds of camp followers; merchants
to purchase the spoil; and those of baser
sort to revel in the expected rapine. The usual
swarm of women were there to make their Circean
camp wherever the troops should halt.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when the van of the Greeks
reached the opening of the Wady. The soldiers
needed rest after their rapid march. Each company
scattered to right or left, maintaining only relative
order. Then silence fell upon the host. Ten thousand
men were scarcely distinguishable from the
rocks and bushes amid which they slept. The sharp
challenge of a sentinel, the accidental clash of a
weapon against a stone, mingled with the hoot of
an owl or the bark of some jackal as he found his
usual path of marauding blocked by the strange
forms of men.</p>

<p>Yet other eyes than those of night-prowling birds
and beasts penetrated the darkness. Judas and his
brethren had taken oversight of the Greek host almost
as comprehensive as was that of Apollonius
and his staff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear," said Judas to a comrade, "lest something
untoward has happened the maiden; for this is the
spot, and the stars mark the hour. God forbid
that we have erred in sending her upon this unwomanly
venture!"</p>

<p>"Yet," said Jonathan, "the information she has
sent us is worth the sacrifice of a life."</p>

<p>"But not such a life, my brother. If she has
been ensnared, I know not how to rejoice in any
victory so dearly bought. Meph says she was at
the very tent of Apollonius."</p>

<p>"You think overmuch of the daughter of Elkiah,"
replied Jonathan. "Besides, she would have her
own way."</p>

<p>"Aye, and has it. List!"</p>

<p>The three whistling notes of a quail floated from
a long distance, and were scarcely answered by the
same signal when a woman stood beside them.</p>

<p>"God be praised!" and the two Maccabees each
raised in turn her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"But why this attire, Deborah? We looked for a
Greek helmet at least," said Judas, touching her
long flowing robe, which even the night showed to
be of a gaudy color.</p>

<p>"The Greek women have the freedom of their
camps," replied Deborah. "No greater dangers than
insulting words have threatened me there, and
words do not harm if the soul does not hear them."</p>

<p>"Still, for every such word a Greek life shall pay
before another night comes," said Jonathan.</p>

<p>"Not in my revenge, brave men," replied Deborah.
"We must not think of such things. What shall we
care for insults when our cause is so shamed? But
to my account. Apollonius rides with the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
division. The squadron of Syrian horse under Syron
leads. Philip has sent a detachment from Jerusalem
to join in the fray. The whole army moves into the
valley at daybreak. God grant it may be to them
the 'valley of the shadow of death.' But yet, how
can I wish such things? Sometimes my woman's
heart cries out against the cruelty of our most
righteous war. But I am woman no longer. My
heart has bled so much that my nature has turned
to blood. Have you any order for me?"</p>

<p>"None, but that you rest. Do not stay near the
battle, for though we pray for victory we are but
a handful against a multitude. Our armor is little
more than our courage; theirs is brass and iron."</p>

<p>"It matters not," said Deborah. "Did you hear
my Caleb's dream? It was of a little hole in the
sandy beach which drank up the sea."</p>

<p>"The Lord grant that this Wady be the hole,"
responded Judas. "If He forsake us not, few of the
Greeks will come out at the other end. But to
your rest, my daughter! You will need great
strength of body and soul to comfort those in the
Fort of the Rocks, who will mourn for many of us
to-morrow. God watch between us!"</p>

<p>Deborah went a little way in the direction of the
Fort of the Rocks. Jonathan accompanied her until
she insisted upon lying down to rest in a secure
spot, feeling too fatigued to resume her journey before
to-morrow.</p>

<p>But no sooner had Jonathan's form disappeared
through the night than she rose.</p>

<p>"I cannot stay away from the battle," she said to
herself. "Many of these, my brothers, will fall. My
place is among them. But this blood, this blood!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
God, must it be? Yet I, a woman, have helped prepare
this slaughter."</p>

<p>She fell upon her knees. "Lord, spare Thy people.
If blood must flow let it be of those only who have
destroyed Thy altars, and blasphemed Thy Holy
Name. Spare Judas and Jonathan, and&mdash;all these
Thy people! Avenge Thou our cause! As the sun
drinks the water from the pools, so may Thy vengeance
drink the blood of the enemy, and Thy
land be purged!"</p>

<p>She rose and walked rapidly, not toward the Fort
of the Rocks, but in the direction of the Greeks.</p>

were venting their rage upon an officer
in command of a contingent sent
from Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"The Captain forbids us to come among his tents;
Astarte curse him! Are his men better than other
men, or better than we?"</p>

<p>"They say he was born in Athens; as if Athens
were better than Antioch!" said one.</p>

<p>"The statue of Athena, the prude, in the Parthenon,
is so big that it crowds out all other gods and
goddesses; and so this upstart Captain would crowd
us out. And are we not goddesses? My Adonis,
the one with a brass pot for a skull, called me one."</p>

<p>"Yes, they call us heavenly, and help us to Hades."</p>

<p>"Captain Dion would make Aphrodite herself
wear long skirts," said another.</p>

<p>"Dion!" The word rang sharp as a thunder-crash
through Deborah's soul. A glare as of the lightning's
bolt seemed to illumine her. In it she saw
herself again a woman. Dion! Was she leading
this man to slaughter? But why not? He, too,
was the enemy of her land, of her religion, of her
God. Had she not vowed death to Greeks of every
name? Did her oath spare even Dion?</p>

<p>Yet Dion had saved her. And that, too, in spite
of his soldierly duty to his cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Deborah staggered back into the darkness. Her
strength until now had been that of a man; but it
was the strength which her soul, with its tremendous
resoluteness, had imparted to nerve and muscle.
Now that her soul was shaken, it sent its quiver
through her physical frame, and she was weak as a
child. She sank upon the ground.</p>

<p>Then one by one came memory's pictures of the
terrors she had experienced in Jerusalem. What had
sustained her during those awful days? Her pride
as the daughter of the house of Elkiah? The necessity
of guarding her blind brother Caleb? Her
faith? All these, doubtless; yet she confessed to herself
that but for the kind words of the Greek Dion
she might have given way. Not his proffered love.
No! No! That alone would have made her hate
him; but he had been good to her. And if&mdash;if God
had used the Greek's kindness, even his love, to sustain
her, to give her strength for her holy devotion,
should she despise this Greek? Should she lead him
into this ambuscade? If he should fall on the morrow
would she not be his murderess? She recoiled
from herself as from some polluted thing.</p>

<p>Then, as a wave receding into the sea comes back,
her feeling was quickly reversed. Had she not taken
delight in imagining herself another Jael, who
could drive the nail through the temple of a foeman
of her people, though he were sleeping in her own
tent. She tried to say, "Even Dion to his death!"
but the sentence would not frame itself in her purpose.
Her brain seemed to stagnate. She could not
think. She prayed, "Lord, I am but as a mould; fill
me with such purpose as Thou wilt!"</p>

<p>At length she said to herself, "I will seek out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Judas, and beg him to spare the advance of the
Greek hosts, for there Dion will be, since his camp
is here foremost."</p>

<p>Scarcely was this project formed when she abandoned
it. The contingent from Jerusalem to which
Dion belonged was as numerous as all Judas' band,
and, if not destroyed in the first surprise of the
attack, might turn the tide of battle. Besides, what
reason could she give Judas for this request? Confess
her attachment to a Greek? If womanly shame
did not forbid such an acknowledgment to another
man, it surely would cost her the confidence of the
Jews. Never again would they believe in the patriotism
or honesty of one whose brother was a traitor,
and whose lover&mdash;for such they would regard Dion&mdash;was
in the hostile camp.</p>

<p>Following her first impulses Deborah had risen
from the ground and walked slowly toward the
place where she knew Judas could be reached by her
signals. But she quickly turned back.</p>

<p>"Might I not warn Dion? Not, of course, his fellow-officers.
But, if I did, would not his sense of
duty lead him to divulge the plot?" She prayed
again for light, but no light came. The gloom
deepened about her. Two spirits were tearing her
soul asunder in their strife for possession. She
thought of her people; of her father dashed to death
by Greek hands beside the altar; then of the brave
band of patriots who, unless they triumphed bloodily
at the very dawn, must themselves be slaughtered
before the nightfall. She felt her personality
dissolving into a flame of zeal for her land and her
people's God. She cried out with uplifted arms:
"O God, I am no longer a woman. I am Thine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Thy Avenging Spirit! Use me as Thou dost use the
lightning's bolt, the flood, the plague, that I may
bring destruction to all this host!"</p>

<p>Then, even as she stood with outstretched arms in
this awful imprecation, there came the vision of
Dion, so noble, though a Greek, with a man's heart
greater than all his racial prejudice; the friend who
had risked life and repute for her father's safety,
though it proved unavailing; the rescuer of blind
Caleb; her own friend&mdash;who loved her, she could not
doubt it&mdash;whose thoughts even now, as he was
moving to his death, were possibly of her.</p>

<p>"O, God!" she exclaimed. "Take away my life.
Let me die rather than make this decision."</p>

<p>She waited, longing that her heart might stop
beating through the violence of its own contentions.
But it beat on. She drew a dagger, and pressed its
point gently against her bosom, as she murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, if it were but right that I should lay down
my life, since God will not take it!"</p>

<p>The crackling of dried leaves caught Deborah's attention.
A sentinel gave challenge.</p>

<p>Deborah instantly responded with the watchword
of the Greek camp, "The sword of Apollonius,"
which she knew had been given for the night.</p>

<p>"Another woman, by Jove! One would think he
had fallen upon the Grove of Daphne, or the streets
of the Piræus, rather than a war camp," said one
walking with the sentry.</p>

<p>"Come, get out of this! To the rear with you, or
we will make you march in front of the first battle."</p>

<p>"I am not within the lines," replied Deborah. "The
lines run from the twisted rock to the cypress yonder.
So we were told."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are those the lines?" asked the officer. "Then let
her stay. We ourselves have lost our bearing, but
daylight is coming up yonder in the East, and we
shall need no longer any lines here, for we move at
dawn."</p>

<p>Deborah could not mistake that voice, nor the
form that the dim light outlined. She thought that
she was silent, enacting a tragedy back of her
rigidly compressed lips; yet some word or outcry
must have escaped her, for the officer turned quickly.</p>

<p>"Woman, did you speak?"</p>

<p>Now she was indeed silent, and moveless as the
great rock against which she leaned. The man
came nearer and tried to scan her features.</p>

<p>"Woman, I have heard your voice before. Have
you followed from Jerusalem?"</p>

<p>A moment elapsed before she replied, but that
moment was like one of those in which we dream,
and live hours and days. She realized that there
had now been forced upon her a quick decision of the
question which the past hour of agonizing debate
with herself had not begun to solve. She had time
in that waiting moment to pray for light. She
gathered up many scenes of those terrible days in the
city, of her flight from Dion's help, of her vow, of
her life as a spy. To these she added the imagined
scenes of the coming day, the slaughter of Greeks,
perhaps the annihilation of the Jewish band, and
extinction of Israel's hopes. She saw all these
things, and central of them all she saw the form
now before her falling beneath some arrow shot
from the covert of the rocks overhanging the valley
he was about to enter. And then she saw herself as
the accomplisher of it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"And this, this," she said to herself, "is to be a
woman's return for a man's love!"</p>

<p>Deborah had often prayed that God would destroy
her sense of personality, that she might be but an
unfeeling agent of His will, as are the lightning and
tempest; but He had not done so. Her human nature
asserted itself over her faith; her individuality
refused to lose itself in her nationality, or shall we
say that her womanhood was stronger than both?
This man and herself were for the instant as essential
factors in her problem as were the Greek and
Jewish armies. But she saw no clearer the solution
of that problem; only that it must be solved,
right or wrong, and at once. So she replied to her
questioner:</p>

<p>"Yes, I came from Jerusalem."</p>

<p>The officer peered closely into her face.</p>

<p>"You are not Greek nor Syrian."</p>

<p>"God be praised, I am not. I am a daughter of
Jerusalem, an outcast from my father's house, as
you would make all the women and children of Israel
to be."</p>

<p>"Deborah! Daughter of Elkiah! Do I dream? Of
all the damnable things that war has brought this
is the most fiendish. You, Deborah, in a soldier's
camp! Good gods! Tell me you are not the daughter
of Elkiah, but some black soul from Erebus
which has found her dead body and entered it."</p>

<p>"Dion, I did not die, but it is true that another
spirit has entered mine."</p>

<p>"Better wert thou dead than live such a life as
this," cried he. "Why did you fly without my help?
I had arranged for your safety. I would have given
my life for yours&mdash;but&mdash;but now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>He grasped her hands, then threw them from him
as something that defiled him. "There is no god
of Jew or Greek, or this could not have been. Tell
me, Deborah, that what I see is not true. That
you&mdash;that you are not here."</p>

<p>He covered his face with his hands as if to banish
the vision of the reality.</p>

<p>"Dion, what you see is true; but what you think
is false&mdash;yes, false and mean as the gods you worship.
An outcast I am, as all my people are; but
not an outcast from honour; not from my father's
faith; not from the favour of my father's God. Your
soldiers have destroyed our homes; where can we
live but in the fields? How can we subsist except
as the beasts and birds do, by picking up the crumbs
which the army of Antiochus drops along its path
of slaughter?"</p>

<p>She laid her hands upon her gaudy garments as if
to tear them from her.</p>

<p>A bugle sounded. It was quickly answered from
far and near. A rustle as of a sudden storm among
the rocks and bushes told that the host was waking.
Then followed the hum of voices, cut with the
sharp words of command, the click of arms, and
clashing of utensils, the neighing of horses and outcries
of grooms and masters.</p>

<p>Dion started a step as if to obey the call.</p>

<p>"Stay, Dion!" she cried, losing for the instant her
self-possession as she realized the fate which hung
above her friend.</p>

<p>The Greek turned, and said in quick words: "My
command awaits me, Deborah. Tell me how I may
save you."</p>

<p>She let him put his hand upon her. As she felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
his touch she saw this much of her problem solved&mdash;he
should not return to his command if a woman's
will or a woman's wiles could prevent it. The love
he offered her she would use not for herself, but for
his own sake. Surely if it were right to deceive an
enemy for his destruction, it were doubly right to
deceive a friend in order to save him.</p>

<p>She replied, "My friend, my father's friend, you
can save me from that which I dread worse than
my own death."</p>

<p>"How? Who threatens you? Let me but hear it,
and my sword will follow him through Jewish or
Greek camp, or through hell itself."</p>

<p>"Let us draw a little more aside," said Deborah.
"The light is so clear now that it shows us."</p>

<p>Dion slowly followed her, pausing again and
again to look toward his camp.</p>

<p>A second bugle denoted that the host was to begin
its march.</p>

<p>"You must go back to your duty," said she. "Go,
I must save myself as I can. The bugle calls
you."</p>

<p>"A more sacred duty calls me here. Deborah, tell
me, what threatens you?"</p>

<p>She gently drew him to a seat beside her upon a
shelving rock which was overcapped by a juniper
bush. Did she mean the tenderness her face expressed,
so near to his? She felt that her look was
like that of a serpent enchanting a bird. She despised
herself and would fain have risen and fled
away from the spot. But as she noted the man's
features, expressing so well the nobility of character
she knew he possessed, and realized also the unselfishness
of his devotion to her, she felt that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
was not altogether practising deceit; that her web,
though spun by her brain, was from substance
drawn from her heart.</p>

<p>"My dear Dion," she said, "the greatest terror
that possesses me is that you think me what my
presence here might suggest. Save me first of
all from falling in your respect. Believe me, I am
still as worthy of your care as when you saw me,
a mere child, in Jerusalem&mdash;though these few months
have made me a woman, I fear with a wicked
heart."</p>

<p>"I do believe you, Deborah," cried he, grasping
both her hands. "Now that the light shows you, I
see the same pure soul I once loved, and never for
an instant have ceased to love. But, my child, you
have suffered. Pain has cut deep lines. This must
cease. If there is anything in my position, my
estate, any influence with those in power, any
strength in my arm or sharpness in my sword, let
me use it. Only tell me."</p>

<p>The trumpet call was repeated. Dion rose, and
stood for a while looking in the direction whence it
had come.</p>

<p>"I can overtake them," he said, hesitating.</p>

<p>"But how explain your absence? Will not some
harm come from your failing to appear with your
command? You should go."</p>

<p>Yet her hands were hard holding his, and her face
wore an intensity of desire which he, not knowing
its full meaning, thought to be only the return of his
love.</p>

<p>"I cannot go," said he. "I will not go, my love,
until you have told me how I can save you. By all
the gods I swear it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Swear not at all," said Deborah, placing her
fingers upon his lips, only to receive the kiss they
tempted.</p>

<p>Dion's arm stole about the form of his companion.
She did not resist it. Why not? Only because thus
she was detaining him. Let him interpret it otherwise;
it was for his life, and when he was saved
they would part forever.</p>

<p>A distant din caught the ear. A wild scream of a
bugle was answered by the blast of scores of trumpets
and the shrieks of a multitude from the direction
of the great Wady.</p>

<p>"An attack!" cried Dion, leaping to his feet.</p>

<p>"Then you must be gone," said Deborah, but still
clinging to him as she pointed. "But see, the Jews
are thronging there. They have lined the hills. An
ambuscade for the Greeks! God be with His people!
Stay, Dion, it is useless to seek your command.
Your soldiers are in the Wady, and Judas&mdash;the
sword of the Lord and of Judas is between them
and us!"</p>

<p>Dion's trained eye took in at once the military
situation.</p>

<p>Yet under the true soldier's impulse, he would have
hastened with single sword to his post of duty,
could he have seen any way thither. The hills lining
the Wady were now black with the Jews; and small
bands were hastening from every direction. He
could not rejoin his soldiers if he would.</p>

<p>Deborah readily drew him back to their covert.
Now and again he would start forth, but as quickly
return, seeing no safe exit. Deborah herself became
changed in look and manner. Her lips opened as if
giving command to the distant soldiers, yet her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
hand on Dion's arm held him captive by the spell of
its touch.</p>

<p>"List! The cry of the sons of Mattathias&mdash;Mi-camo-ca-ba!
'who is like unto thee among the Gods!'
Judas is conquering. See! See! Our people are
over the hilltops. They are rushing down into the
Wady. God be praised! The sword of the Lord
and of Judas!"</p>

<p>She seemed to forget the presence of her companion,
yet at the slightest movement on his part her hand
stayed him.</p>

<p>"I will hasten to the eastward. Surely our troops
will cut their way out there upon the open road,"
cried Dion.</p>

<p>"Nay, but see! Jonathan and the men from Hebron
are there."</p>

<p>"Then I can follow into the ravine and die with
my brave soldiers."</p>

<p>"That way is also closed," said Deborah, "for
Simon and the tribesmen from the north are pressing
in after the Greeks. Look!"</p>

<p>"How knew you this?" cried Dion, as his trained
eye saw that the woman was correct. "Are you a
spirit of battle? Do you hold the armies of Antiochus
as you have held me? Are you witch, or are
you woman?"</p>

<p>"I know not," she replied, "I only know that Dion
dies not to-day with the rest."</p>

<p>Then the Greek broke away from his captor. It
was but for a moment, for all around were Jews,
who sprang up as if from the ground.</p>

<p>"Back, back, or you are slain! These peasants
never miss with the arrow or sling. Back!"</p>

<p>She drew him to the covert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"For myself I care not, but you."</p>

<p>"For my sake then, O Dion, do not leave me.
They will kill me. Save me, Dion! Back! They
will see your Greek armor, and the arrows will not
leave a branch on the tree if you are detected.
Back!"</p>

<p>She had scarcely spoken when a missile clanged
against the rock at her side. Deborah sprang from
the covert, and stood exposed in the open. Dion
heard the call of a Jew to his comrades:</p>

<p>"It is only a woman; forward, men!"</p>

<p>The group of patriots hurried by.</p>

<p>Deborah scanned the field far and wide. Seeing
that the Jews had all entered the ravine, she turned
to her companion:</p>

<p>"Dion, go quickly! Once Dion was called a traitor
to his people because he saved the daughter of
Elkiah; to-day Elkiah's child had almost betrayed
her people that she might save the life of the noblest
of Greeks. Hasten away."</p>

<p>His arms would have retained her, but swift as a
frightened fawn she ran, and, breathless in his futile
pursuit, the Greek watched her agile form until it
disappeared among the throngs which marked the
edge of the battle. Then he sought to rejoin his
forces. But it was only to be caught in a crowd of
fugitives who had escaped from the Wady, and, helmetless,
were making their way to the west.</p>

<p>The setting sun that day was not so red as the
blood-stained rocks in the Wady. Thousands of
corpses lay amid the broken spear-shafts and empty
helmets which lined the dry bed of the brook, waiting
until the next winter's storms should flood its
banks and wash away the signs of one of the grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>est
victories of few over many that history has ever
recorded.</p>

<p>The sublimest heroism of that heroic day was displayed
by Judas himself. Heading a band of choice
spirits, he leaped from rock to rock down the side of
the narrow valley, as a wild beast descends upon
its prey. He made straight for the spot where helmets
were brightest and the banners most enriched
with blazonry, denoting the body-guard of Apollonius.
His voice, like a lion, roaring the war cry
'Mi-camo-ca-ba,' scarcely revealed his presence before
his sword was crossing that of the famous General.</p>

<p>The gigantic stature of Judas, together with his
tremendous strength and fury, well matched any
superior skill of fence the Greek might have had.
Their swords intertwined like two writhing serpents,
neither daring to loosen its grip of the other. But
steadily the Jew forced Apollonius to give ground
until he was driven back against a rock which prevented
the free use of his arm. Then the swords
disentangled, and that of Judas entered the throat
of his antagonist.</p>

<p>The conflict was over. Judas gathered his scattered
bands. Laden with spoil&mdash;provisions, arms,
and boxes filled with coins&mdash;they emerged from the
Wady.</p>

<p>Upon a knoll stood the five brethren; about them
the warriors, wearied with their work, and sickened
with their deep draughts of blood. Judas knelt,
and the little host fell prostrate upon the ground in
silent prayer. Then, as they rose, a woman's voice
raised the old song of Miriam by the Red Sea, and
the multitude joined as in the synagogue; but with
what new meaning in their faith!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed
gloriously. Thy right hand hath dashed in pieces
the enemy."</p>

<p>When the shouts and psalms had died away Judas
lifted the sword which he himself had wrested from
the death-clutch of Apollonius. It was a slender
weapon; its handle of fretted gold, its blue steel
blade etched with representations of the labors of
Herakles.</p>

<p>"Listen, my brave men! This sword belongs to
the daughter of Elkiah. Her prowess and her
prophecy have won it."</p>

<p>None but he and she knew his meaning, for she
had told him of the scene in Apollonius' house in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Deborah looked upon the blade. She took it into
her hand a moment. One near enough might have
heard:</p>

<p>"It is the same. I thank thee, O Lord, that a
more fitting hand than mine has done this deed."</p>

<p>She then bound the sword of Apollonius upon the
thigh of Judas.</p>

<p>"So the Lord gird thee with strength!" she said.</p>

<p>As, according to Jewish tradition, David wore the
sword of the fallen Goliath through all his glorious
wars, so Judas carried the sword of Apollonius,
until five years later it was buried in the grave of
the founder of the Maccabæan dynasty of Jewish
patriots.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> victory of the Jews at the Wady
winged the fame of Judas far and wide.
Among his own people the chosen war-cry
"Mi-camo-ca-ba" gave place to the
contracted word "Ma-ca-ba" or "Maccabee,"
the Hammer, a title significant of the swift
and crushing blows with which he smote the enemy.</p>

<p>Even the tribesmen about the borders of the Holy
Land, the Horites in the caves of Petra, and the
dwellers in the flint castles of the desert, wondered
if a new deliverer had risen in Israel. In black
tents on the plains and in strongholds among the
cliffs were told again and again the old stories of
the Jewish judges; while the Arab sheikhs of the
Jordan valley deliberated if it were not wise to cast
in their lot with a people who, even if not favored
directly of heaven, might by such human valor as
Judas and his men had displayed, beat back the
deluge of Greek power which threatened to submerge
their own as well as Israel's possessions.</p>

<p>Among the Jews the enthusiasm was like a fire
amid brambles, so rapidly did it spread. Simon, the
Wise, was persistent in his counsel for patience, and
for wide and cautious preparation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_159.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"Remember, my brethren," said he, "that we are
not boiling a pot, but are to consume the very
Cedars of Lebanon&mdash;for such is this gigantic power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>of the north which menaces us. The fight in the
Wady was but the beginning of battles. Antiochus
has many armies. He will gather fresh hordes from
the nations which own his sway. We have only
wounded this wild beast of Antioch. He will turn
again upon us with more ravening strength."</p>

<p>The news of the overwhelming defeat of Apollonius
brought consternation to the Greeks, and especially
to the renegades in Jerusalem. Every one who repeated
the tidings added what he or she feared, until
the numbers of the Jewish patriots were swollen to
vast multitudes in the popular mind. The more sagacious
assumed that the Jews must be in alliance
with the great nations which were contesting the
dominion of Antiochus beyond the deserts in the
Euphrates valley. Some had it that the Egyptian
Ptolemy had resumed war against Syria; and even
Rome was rumored to have thrown her sword into
the scale; for it was incredible that an untrained
peasant, with so small a force of herdsmen as the
Jews were reputed to have had, could outwit one
of Apollonius' astuteness, and with a single blow
shatter his phalanges.</p>

<p>Imagination, made sensitive by fright, pictured the
valleys beyond the hills filled with strange armies.
Squads of Greek horsemen would scurry rapidly
across open fields, then halt for long observation on
the hilltops before venturing another dash. Popular
superstition transformed Judas himself into a
demi-god, or one of the ancient worthies of Israel,
Samson or Gideon, returned to earth.</p>

<p>"They say he is as big as Pelops, and carries a
whole tree-trunk for his mace," said a Greek soldier,
looking stealthily behind him, and watching an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
olive clump whose stiff branches shook in the evening
breeze.</p>

<p>The gates of Jerusalem were now closed by day as
well as by night. Watchers patrolled without the
walls, so that not a goat approached without being
scrutinized, "lest," said a Greek wag, "his horns
should prove to be the head-piece of another Alexander,
the great Macedonian, who wore such horns
for his crest."</p>

<p>The only inhabitants permitted free access and
egress at the city gates were the women who went
daily to the brook Kedron, bearing loads of clothing
which they hastily washed in the running water,
with faces made white as the linen by the stories
their fright invented. At any moment this terrible
Judas might leap upon them out of the hills or the
heavens.</p>

<p>A group of these women were one morning at the
Siloam pool. Among them was one of well-bronzed
face, and short black hair which sprayed out beneath
the close folding of her soiled kerchief. This
woman was accompanied by a child who sat upon
the brink of the brook, that his feet might feel the
brush of cool water as it flowed by. She untied a
hamper of garments which she had carried upon her
head, and, tying up her skirts above her knees,
waded into the stream. Like the others, she dipped
the pieces altogether into the water, pounded them
one by one with a short wooden club, then wrung
each garment into a tight little bundle, and flung it
upon the bank.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry arose among the women. A cloud
of dust appeared upon the old road leading from
Bethany. All gathered their laundered work, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
hastily climbed the steep ascent to the southern
gate of the city.</p>

<p>"Is it Judas?" asked the boy. "Can we get in before
he catches us?"</p>

<p>"If we hurry," replied the woman. "Come."</p>

<p>"I wish it were Judas," said another, pausing in
the shadow of the tower above the gate. "Since
these Greek fashions have come there is nothing but
wash, wash. The new Princess has enough white
linen to cover the peak of Hermon as the snows do,
and enough coloured garments to make her like a
sunset."</p>

<p>"Is she beautiful?" asked the strange washerwoman.</p>

<p>"So the men say, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But? Go on."</p>

<p>"Why, you yourself, girl, would be fairer than the
Princess if you had one of her jewels in your hair.
And as for her figure, no one sees her except as she
lies like a painted statue in the palanquin. She
may have a turtle's back and duck's legs, for all
she arches her neck like a swan."</p>

<p>The clamour of the washerwomen sufficed without
further watchword with the sentry at the gate,
who opened to them the "needle's eye" or small
door. Once within the city they could not be induced
to venture out again for the day, though
assured that the imagined Judas was only a Greek
courier riding from the direction of Jericho, who
brought tidings that no enemy was to be seen for a
distance of twenty stadia in any direction.</p>

<p>Passing the cellar-like tunnel beneath the city wall
the laundresses scattered, each in her own way,
through the streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman we have described, with her load upon
her head like a huge turban, and with the lad clinging
to her skirts, went up the Cheesemakers' Street
to the Street of David. She paused an instant by
the little altar which stood by the street door of the
house of Glaucon, whether in detestation of this
sacrilege of a home devoted to piety or to offer a
pinch of incense, an observer could not have told.
She rapped sharply at the gate. The bar was instantly
dropped from within. A short, stout man,
whose long temple locks were well whitened with
years, stood in the half opening.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said he, as he saw the unexpected
visitors.</p>

<p>Before the woman could make response, the child
had uttered a cry, "It's Ephraim! It's Ephraim!"</p>

<p>The man started back, and stared at the lad.</p>

<p>"As the Lord liveth!" he exclaimed, and caught
the boy to his arms. "Surely Sheol has opened its
gates. But where, woman, have you found him?"</p>

<p>"It's Deborah, too!" cried the lad. "Are you
blind, Ephraim, that you cannot see Deborah?"</p>

<p>The woman passed through the door, and dropped
the bundle from her head upon the pavement of the
court.</p>

<p>Old Ephraim gazed stupidly at her. Then he
clutched the boy closely, as if it were necessary to
re-enforce vision by feeling the living child, ere he
could credit his senses.</p>

<p>"God be praised! It is she. My master's children,
both!"</p>

<p>Overcome as by an apparition, the old servant
staggered for a moment, then with a spasmodic
burst of strength grasped the door, swung it shut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
dropped the heavy cross-bar between the lintels,
and stood with his whole weight against it.</p>

<p>"Ephraim, I am not pursued; no one will harm
me here," said Deborah.</p>

<p>"No one dare touch you here," replied he, with a
fierce look at the closed portal, as if in challenge of
men and demons without. "No one will touch you
here, but&mdash;but you shall not go away again."</p>

<p>Ephraim glanced up at the sky, which dropped its
light into the open square court around which the
house was built, as if he would close that way of
exit also, apparently imagining that it was only by
some such aerial flight that Deborah had formerly
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Is Benjamin here?" inquired Deborah.</p>

<p>"Benjamin! God bless your lips for speaking that
name once more. It's many a day since we have
heard anything but 'Glaucon,' 'Glaucon,' as the son
of Elkiah has gone in and out of his father's house.
Aye, he smote me in the face for repeating the name
we called him when, on the eighth day of his life,
we circumcised him according to the Law&mdash;the name
recorded in the Temple when, about as big as Caleb,
he was enrolled as a Son of the Law, and the
fringes put upon his coat. But whence came you,
my daughter? And why this dress of the serving
women? And your hands are hard, and your feet
torn, and your beautiful hair is cut off, and years
have come into your face. When Huldah shall see
you, she will cry tears that are bitter as well as
gladsome, for your old nurse has sat in the house
like 'Rachel, mourning for her children, and refusing
to be comforted, because they were not.' Poor
hands!" He raised them to his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your kiss, good Ephraim, has gone far to heal
them," replied Deborah, with moistened eyes.</p>

<p>"And in this?" touching her garment, as if it were
some unworthy thing that defiled an altar. "In
this? The daughter of my master, with robes in
her chamber fit for Sheba's queen, clad like a water
carrier?"</p>

<p>"Huldah's fingers and mine will soon remedy these
things," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"That they shall"; and Ephraim's voice rang
through the house:</p>

<p>"Huldah! Huldah!"</p>

<p>The old woman appeared upon the scene, with
eyes flashing contemptuously from beneath the white
mantle which covered her head.</p>

<p>"What now, Ephraim? Are you grown so old
that you dare not push the beggars from the door?
I'll show you that a woman's strength does not
ooze out through her wrinkles."</p>

<p>She made at the intruders, but her prowess vanished
as quickly as the strength goes from a broken
bow.</p>

<p>"My mistress! My darlings!"</p>

<p>She threw herself prone upon the pavement of the
court, kissed the feet of Deborah, and fondled them.</p>

<p>"Poor bruised things!"</p>

<p>She could not rise, for Caleb had thrown himself
into the lap of the woman, who, when the first
paroxysm of her excitement was gone, sat crooning
over the child, forgetful of the weary months
during which her arms had longed for him as if he
had been her own.</p>

<p>"You were always a mother to us, Huldah. The
Lord bless your dear good heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"And to think that you were away from me, and
wanting me!" cried the nurse, hugging closer the
blind child.</p>

<p>"The Lord has been with us," replied Deborah.
"Some day I will tell you all."</p>

<p>"I would have known all that happened to my
master's daughter," said Ephraim, "if I had known
whither you had gone, for with you I had gone
also. Here have I stayed, not for love of Benjamin,
but because I did not know where to go to
seek you."</p>

<p>"The Lord reward you, Ephraim! And now let
me go to my chamber."</p>

<p>"That alone has been untouched," said Huldah.
"You see that all else has been changed."</p>

<p>Ephraim led the way across the court, Huldah
following, carrying Caleb.</p>

<p>In the centre of the court played the little fountain;
but it no longer sent up its simple sheaf of
spray. The water now trickled from the hands of
marble Cupids, and fell upon the nude form of Aphrodite,
and filled a shell-shaped basin at her feet.
At the corners of the court stood exquisite sculptures,
evidencing the new taste of the master of the
house.</p>

<p>As Deborah stepped upon the platform, or open
square room which served as the entrance hall to
the living apartments, she was confronted by a
middle-aged man, in white chiton and embroidered
girdle, with close-curled locks and flat face. His
lofty but otherwise expressionless look, and the
stiffness of the motion by which he simulated dignity,
indicated that he was the chief of several Greek
servants whom Glaucon had installed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not in here, woman," said he, putting his hand
upon Deborah. "You Jewish dog," he added, addressing
Ephraim, "have you forgotten your business,
to bring your street herd into the house? I'll
teach you."</p>

<p>He raised his hand to strike him, but Deborah's
arm intercepted the blow.</p>

<p>"Hold, I am mistress here," she said.</p>

<p>Her shabby garb could not disguise her supreme
grace of mien, nor did her weather-bronzed skin
hide the beauty of her face or lessen the tone of refinement
in her voice. The man stared in motionless
amazement as she raised the curtain and passed
within, bidding Huldah to follow.</p>

<p>Leaving Ephraim to tell the story of her identity,
she entered the first lower chamber, the reception-room
of the mansion. She noted the strange and
foreign things which had taken the place of the familiar
furniture, much of which had been the heirloom
of many generations; then she passed to her
own chamber. Here, as Huldah pointed out, everything
was as she had left it the day of her flight.</p>

<p>"Now, good mother, let us be alone," said she,
with a fond embrace of the old nurse.</p>

<p>"Here is the key of the chest," said Huldah, after
much fumbling in her bosom, and nearly denuding
herself in the search. "The Greek slaves that Benjamin
has hired steal everything that their fingers
touch. But they have not come in here. Even Benjamin
swore to kill them if they did, though they
have opened all his closets, except the hidden ones
between the walls."</p>

<p>When they were alone, and Caleb, tired of seeing
every familiar thing with those eyes in his fingers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
had dropped to sleep upon the couch, Deborah knelt
by the side of it&mdash;the bed which had been hers in
childhood. She would pray. But quick memories
wrought a veil that shut out the present communion.
She recollected her mother that day when they
carried her out to be buried, and when, as a parting
gift, she left them little Caleb. She thought of the
happy years when Benjamin had taken her upon his
big boyish shoulders, and played with her on the
roof-top, and down by the brook Kedron where she
had been to-day. She had been wont to dream of
Benjamin as a prince among the people, and wondered
if the Messiah, when He should come, would
be handsomer or braver or kinder than her brother.
Then she recalled the strange sickness that had fallen
upon Caleb; the days of pain which her little mother-hands
alone could exorcise from his hot temples
and writhing form; and how, when the sickness
passed, his eyes grew larger, as if seeing things far
away, but saw not anything that others looked
upon. She sat again at her father's feet, and learned
from his lips the sacred precepts of the Law and the
thrilling stories of her nation's heroes, and the wonders
of Jehovah's arm made bare for Israel's deliverance.
God had been to her in those childhood days
a Presence of which she seemed conscious&mdash;the clouds
His robes of glory, and every whispering breeze His
assurance of love and care.</p>

<p>But now&mdash;she tried to pray, but her prayer was
only like the cry of a child in fright. Her soul
threw out its arms blindly grasping at she knew
not what&mdash;yet called that unknown "God's Will."</p>

<p>How weak she was! And yet how strong!</p>

<p>She realized that she was but as a leaf in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
stream which the current carries along, but which
the current cannot sink. True, she could not resist
the terrible tide of circumstances into which her lot
was cast, but neither could these circumstances destroy
her. She stood with clenched hands, motionless,
looking at nothing.</p>

<p>Her lips moved, and this they said: "I cannot even
pray. I was Elkiah's daughter, but now I am not
even a woman; I am a spirit, vengeful, hating, deceiving,
or I could not do this thing. Yet surely, I
am Elkiah's daughter. This is my chamber. And
this, and this, and this is mine. O, my father, forgive
me! And yet thy sainted spirit called me to
come home again. O, Lord God of my father, help
me to honour his name, and to save his house!"</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Deborah</span> threw off her coarse garment,
and before the mirror of polished brass&mdash;in
which many generations of women
had been made conscious of the beauty
for which their family was famous&mdash;she
arranged her hair as decorously as its brief length
permitted, supplementing its lost beauty with a
band of pearls which she discovered in the great
carved wooden chest. Her arms were now as sun-stained
as those of a Bedouin maiden from the
tribes beyond Jordan, and made goodly contrast
with the silver bracelets which once scarcely rivalled
the whiteness of her skin. She donned an embroidered
bodice and outer robe of white linen, and put
on the sandals with the golden-threaded strings
binding the ankles, such as she had often worn.</p>

<p>"Once more I am the daughter of Elkiah."</p>

<p>A momentary flush of pride answered the reflection
in the mirror.</p>

<p>She pushed it from her, and sat with folded hands
upon the couch.</p>

<p>"A hypocrite! What better am I than that brazen
mistress of Apollonius? Oh, God, must I do this?
A spy in the house of my father? Lord, lead me.
Save me from wrong-doing. Yet is it not Thy will?"</p>

<p>"What is it, sister?" asked Caleb, who was now
awakened by Deborah's soliloquy. He stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
out his hands to her, but shrank back as he felt the
strange texture of her robe.</p>

<p>"We are home again, my dear. Come, you must
wear your pretty clothes."</p>

<p>While dressing Caleb neither of them spoke, for
their attention was drawn to loud voices which
sounded from the adjacent chamber.</p>

<p>"The Lord be with thee, Glaucon!"</p>

<p>"And with thee, Menelaos!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! you haven't forgotten your old-time
piety."</p>

<p>"If I had, the presence of the High Priest would
revive the memory. I take it that your office has
more agreeable functions, now that the King will
not allow the priests to smell so much of blood and
offal as formerly. A journey to Antioch, a chariot
in the processions, and a symposium in the King's
new banqueting-hall&mdash;though the wine has too much
mastic in it&mdash;must be preferable to playing chief
butcher at the Temple. Is it not so, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Glaucon! Your words have too much
truth in them to be agreeable," replied Menelaos.
"But, by Jove!&mdash;it is convenient to have an oath
one can use without blasphemy&mdash;by Jove! I would
rather be here hobnobbing with an old comrade
than tripping up on my official skirts in Antioch."</p>

<p>The Priest threw himself upon the wide divan,
while an attendant arranged behind him a pile of
cushions.</p>

<p>"Wine, Ajax!" cried Glaucon. "I am sorry we
must take it no cooler than the cellar, for these
rebels have let no snow be brought from Hermon
since they sent Apollonius across the Styx."</p>

<p>"The gods forbid that that ravening beast Judas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
cut off other supplies," replied the Priest. "Not a
partridge nor a fish has been sold at the market for
a fortnight. The Princess will have double cause for
grief over the death of her cousin, the General, if she
stays in Jerusalem. So goodly a bit of flesh should
be fed better. But a fine convoy is coming down
from Antioch."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt about her kinship to the
General?" asked Glaucon.</p>

<p>"Oh, none whatever. Apollonius' letter to me implied
as much. They say she has great riches. The
tribute of a whole city in Anatolia, or Syria, or the
devil may guess where, follows her; for Apollonius
was as bold in robbing his enemies as he was in
killing them; and he loved the woman so well that
he would have let her melt off his legs had they been
golden. The Princess says that a thousand shekels
belonging to her were in Apollonius' military chest
and fell into the hands of the damned Maccabaean."</p>

<p>"That is the worst thing I have heard about
Judas' victory," laughed Glaucon. "But the Princess
has plenty of credit, I take it, even if she can't
transport through the air the gold plates on the
roofs of her many palaces."</p>

<p>"Gold plates or thatch, she's rich enough," rejoined
the Priest. "And, by Aphrodite's ankle! what
a woman she is! Glaucon, if it were not that I
have already at least one wife, I would cut your
throat for jealousy, for Helena evidently takes to
you. She has an eye for manly beauty. And you,
Glaucon, have a face which, but for the twist in
your nose that the alipta has not yet mollified
enough to straighten out, would be the face of a
god. You are an Adonis in figure. If I had your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
shoulders and calves I would forswear priest's
robes. What a couple you and the Princess would
make!"</p>

<p>The click of a brass mirror was heard as Glaucon
replied, "'By Aphrodite's ankle!' A good oath that.
I will remember it. 'By Aphrodite's ankle!' Ha!
ha! A good saying! a good saying! The Princess
is a beauty, I swear! Her lips are always red."</p>

<p>"Not from over-use either, I take it," interjected
his coacher.</p>

<p>"And her skin so fair!"</p>

<p>"Never saw anything fairer outside the shop of
Demos, the cosmetic seller in Antioch," replied Menelaos.
"And, by Jove, you are a fool, Glaucon, if
you don't get her. Listen! With all of her distant
possessions I happen to know that the loss of
Apollonius' box left her in need of ready money;
ready money, you understand, for she has plenty
that isn't ready. I proposed to advance her a few
shekels, but my wife Lydia, the chaste&mdash;please tell
her I called her that&mdash;objects on the ground that as
High Priest I should not lend money. But really,
my wife is as jealous of Helena as a hen is of a
duck. A gift from your strong-box, Glaucon, would
not be a bad investment. 'Cast thy bread upon the
waters,' says Solomon, 'and thou shalt find it after
many days.' I commend the precept to your piety,
son of Elkiah the provident."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could spare something," said Glaucon,
musingly.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it," replied the Priest, "else you
have not used well the office I have secured for you.
And how goes farming the taxes?"</p>

<p>"Thanks to your favouring me at Antioch, my good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Menelaos, I am in fair prospect, though we have
not much gold in Jerusalem. The soldiers have
gleaned everything that glittered. But I am getting
hold of some estates, the heirs to which have either
been killed or have joined the rebels, so that their
titles revert to the King. For these he gives me fair
commission.</p>

<p>"But there is one matter that puzzles me, Menelaos.
Do you remember the house of Shattuck? It
is now a score and a half years since that family
disappeared from the city. Hosea ben Shattuck
was a merchant in Sidon wares, his shop where the
Street of David bends toward the Tyropean, his
house the great one by the Tower of David. Report
has it that he journeyed to Alexandria&mdash;took ship at
Gaza&mdash;but he never returned. As Shattuck was unmarried
there seems to be no one interested in
chronicling his whereabouts. The property is now
one of the largest on the tax list. I could secure the
title for the value of a pedlar's pack. Among my
father's accounts I found the evidence of Shattuck's
indebtedness to the house of Elkiah in the sum of
fivescore shekels, some little matter of business
between them, such as my father would never press
against a neighbor. Though he did not ask the repayment
of it, he made record, as was his habit in
all money matters. He would not exact usury from
a fellow Jew, but with the usury such as our new
customs allow it would amount to thrice as much
as the original debt."</p>

<p>"Claim the property, the whole of it, or you are a
fool for a Jew, much more for a Greek," said Menelaos
eagerly.</p>

<p>"But if any heir should return?" queried Glaucon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you said there was no heir."</p>

<p>"True, but one doesn't always know about such
matters."</p>

<p>"Well, if there be, what then? On what ground
could he make claim for restitution? All titles of
absentees now rest with the King. The property,
according to the last edict, will be confiscated.
I can fix it at Antioch that your indebtedness
will be recognized. One hundred? Make it a thousand.
I myself will file claim, and vouch for it that
your credit in the matter is worth the entire estate
of Shattuck."</p>

<p>"You have great power with the King, my dear
Menelaos."</p>

<p>"Power with the King? Why, I bought him when
I bought my High Priesthood. You know that
Jason, my brother, sent me to Antioch with six
hundred talents to bribe the royal pleasure for his
appointment to be High Priest. I appropriated the
six hundred, added three hundred more to it, and
bought the office for myself; and so outplayed the
young trickster at his own game. Beside that, you
recollect that it was I who gave Jerusalem to the
King."</p>

<p>"How was that? I am not so well versed in state
secrets as I should be," replied Glaucon.</p>

<p>"Why, when Jason, the Priest, came suddenly back
from Egypt, hearing the false report that Antiochus
had died, he threw me into the dungeon at Akra.
To rescue me, and regain my conduct of affairs, the
King sent his army and took the city. So without
me the King would not have had it. No man, my
dear friend, has had more to do with making the
King's fortune than I. And he cannot dispense with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
me yet. But I must have some return for what I
do for him&mdash;and for you. For my part in your business,
Glaucon, I shall have what portion of the
gain?"</p>

<p>"A third," said Glaucon, hesitating, and watching
the face of his comrade.</p>

<p>"Make it half."</p>

<p>"The old greed, Menelaos. The same that always
claimed the fattest bird we snared together when
we were boys."</p>

<p>"Greed! A proper taunt from the lips of the son
of Elkiah, indeed. Who secured for you your office
of tax-farmer? And how many other estates have
you tapped like a wine-skin to fill your own jars, of
which you have told me nothing? Simon ben Shem
wants to be tax-farmer in your stead. He has done
as much for me as you have, and will pay me a
higher rate for protection at Antioch."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Menelaos," cried Glaucon, quivering
before the Priest's gaze like a bird bewitched by the
eyes of a snake. "I always bantered you for taking
the largest game; but in the end, as you know, always
let you have it. Let it be play between
us."</p>

<p>"Good!" replied Menelaos. "And what news of
the Greek who loved you so well that he split your
skull with the discus?"</p>

<p>"I fear," said Glaucon, "that we will get no news
from Dion. He was in command of a company sent
from our city garrison, and not a man has returned.
Poor Dion! Next to yourself, Menelaos, I never had
a truer friend. Thorough Greek that he was, he
seemed to have a love for our people. He knew the
legends of Moses as well as he knew the stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Homer, and I think he loved them better. The
Lord rest his soul if we see him no more!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" said the Priest. "May Pluto give him a
high place at his banquets, for Dion was a good
roysterer. He was as faithful to your father as
Æneas was to his. And he could not have searched
the camps for your brother and sister more thoroughly
had he been her lover. But farewell! The
blessing of Jehovah, or Jove, or both, be with you,
Glaucon; and the smile of the Princess. Farewell!"</p>

<p>"Jehovah, Jove, damn him," ejaculated Glaucon,
as he threw himself upon the divan the High Priest
had left. "It is bad enough for one like me to have
turned against one's people, one's own house; but
for a High Priest to become a heathen&mdash;High Devil!
Faugh! Wine, Ajax! My purple himation! The
large mirror! Some oil, here! Do the locks curl at
the neck? Call the litter. I'll away to the Princess,
and cast my bread&mdash;Ha! ha!"</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">"Stay</span>, Benjamin!" cried Deborah, thrusting
aside the curtains. She stood a
moment at the opening, scarcely recognizing
her brother in the heavy-lipped
and maudlin face, the artificial curls,
and the costume of a Greek exquisite.</p>

<p>Benjamin stared an instant in stupid curiosity,
then took a step or two in fright.</p>

<p>"It is I! And Caleb!" cried Deborah, seizing his
hands and putting them about herself, and pressing
her face to his.</p>

<p>"God has been good to us, and brought us home,
Benjamin," shouted Caleb, eager for his embrace.</p>

<p>"It is true. Yes, yes, it must be so," said Glaucon,
at length coming to his senses, with a flash of his
old affectionate nature, like a waning ember, lighting
up his face with a suggestion of its former beauty.</p>

<p>He drew his sister and brother both to the couch,
and sat between them, staring from one to the other.</p>

<p>"And you? You were not killed? What has happened?
Where were you taken?"</p>

<p>A few words sufficed to tell him all that she cared
to have him know&mdash;that she had fled for her life;
had fallen among friends; had not dared to return
to Jerusalem before this, fearing some repetition of
the insults such as Apollonius had once offered her.
But that now the Governor was gone, she had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
again to be under the care of her natural and legal
guardian, "and, God willing," she said, "that the
house of Elkiah may again be graced by the presence
of woman and child."</p>

<p>Glaucon's manner evidenced much restraint. He
was not at ease in expressing even the kindliness
and affection he felt, for he had felt so little of these
emotions that he had no words in readiness to convey
them. There was the difference between his
brotherly welcome and that given by the old servants
that there is between the shaduff, toilsomely
lifting its bucket of water at a time, and a fountain
pouring out its welcome to the upcoming flowers.
Very soon the sentimental part of the interview was
past, and Glaucon proceeded to the practical.</p>

<p>"If, my sister, you are to abide at home, since the
King is extremely jealous of the loyalty of the old
Jewish families, it would be well to adopt a name
less clannish than your present one."</p>

<p>"Call me what you will, brother. I will know
myself only by the name my mother gave me. I can,
however, quickly interpret any other word into
that."</p>

<p>Glaucon's mind was opaque to the fine sarcasm of
his sister; he proceeded:</p>

<p>"Berenice is a beautiful name among the Greeks.
You know the story of Queen Berenice? No? Then
I will tell it to you as I have heard the Princess
Helena tell it. I think the Princess has hair like
Berenice's, soft and silky as glistening light. You
must come to know the Princess."</p>

<p>"But the story of Berenice?" interjected Deborah,
wearily.</p>

<p>"It is a fair story as she told it to me," replied he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
"Berenice was the wife of King Ptolemy of Egypt;
he who was called Euergetes, which means Benefactor.
Berenice was the loveliest of women. Her eyes
gleamed with starlight, and her hair flowed about
her shoulders like the mingling rays of the sun and
moon.</p>

<p>"Once, when the King was warring in Syrian
lands, his queen made a vow to the gods that, if
they would return her lord safely to her arms, she
would cut off her hair, and consecrate it in a temple
in Cyprus. The gods were tempted by this gift, and
gave Ptolemy wondrous victories and a speedy
return. Berenice fulfilled her vow. But such was the
beauty of her locks that they dazzled the eyes of the
beholders who came into the temple. Whereupon the
gods hung Berenice's hair in the sky, and there it is
still. You may see it any night. It is gathered into
seven nodes which seem to be stars. All of our
Greek astrologers know of the constellation of
Berenice's hair. The charming poet, Callimachus,
made a hymn in praise of this new beauty of the
heavens. I will sing it to you."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Deborah, "the story is fine enough
as you have told it. Do not sing it. But my black
threads do not suggest the starry brightness of
Berenice's locks. The name would better fit some
fair-haired woman. But call me what you will, my
brother. And how shall we know the child? Caleb
means 'God's dog.' What will that be in
Greek?"</p>

<p>"The Greeks have that spirit in them that one
would not be the dog of even Diana, the goddess of
the chase. Theodorus is a pretty name, and means,
'gift of the gods.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let him be called, then, Theodorus," said Deborah,
with an acquiescing smile.</p>

<p>"But Berenice must dress more gayly than Deborah
did," added her brother. "This bodice looks like
one that came out of Egypt with Miriam, and for
aught I know this linen was made by one of
Pharaoh's weavers, and was picked up on the shores
of the Red Sea."</p>

<p>"Our mother wore these, and she was counted the
most beautiful woman in Jewry," replied Deborah.
"Besides, I have scores of changes made of stuffs
such as are rarely seen in these days. As for jewels,
caps of coin, ear-rings, necklaces, anklets and armlets,
we have enough to deck out a score of maidens,
and laces which the princesses of Egypt have worn,
and robes of the most expensive Tyrian dye. The
daughter of Elkiah need not fear to appear among
the gentlewomen, come they from Antioch, or even
the new capital of Rome."</p>

<p>"True enough as far as value goes," replied Glaucon.
"But these are not in the fashion. When you
see the Princess Helena you will envy her the new
shapes of dresses and jewelry. She is fairer than
you. The sun has tarnished your complexion, but
she can teach you how to bleach it."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt," interjected Deborah.</p>

<p>"But," continued Glaucon, "when our Berenice is
clad as well as the Princess she need not be ashamed
before even that marvellous woman."</p>

<p>"Thanks, my brother."</p>

<p>"I would that Dion could see you in the costume
I shall have sent you from Antioch."</p>

<p>"Does Dion live?" asked Deborah.</p>

<p>"Dion, I fear, is dead. A curse on those treacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>ous
sons of Mattathias. Sons of Belial! But," he
rattled on, "it will be well to make known to the
people of the better sort in Jerusalem the return of
the mistress of the house of Glaucon. I will see to
it that the wife of Menelaos, the High Priest, and
the wife of General Seron&mdash;who is to command the
new army of the King&mdash;and the Princess make their
welcome to you. Berenice, sister of Glaucon: why
may she not some day be Queen of Jerusalem?
Already, my sister, with the wealth our father left
me, and much more that I have gained through my
own shrewdness&mdash;for I am the best business head in
the land&mdash;I am the richest man in the city; and
with the revenues I can control in my office as tax
assessor, I can soon buy what I will from the
King."</p>

<p>"I fear, my dear Benjamin&mdash;my dear Glaucon,"
said the new Berenice, gently touching her brother's
cheeks, "that the glitter of your riches has affected
your head as the sun's rays sometimes do. As for
the new garments, I shall be glad of anything that
makes me fairer in your eyes; but I still bethink me
that the apparel of Jewish women is more elegant
than that of the Greeks. Indeed, the better costumes
of Athens are borrowed from those of Syria. Of
late years, since the death of our mother, and since
the sorrows of the land crushed our father, the great
oaken chests have been unopened. In them are garments
laid away in cassia dust, for which the costumers
of Antioch would give more shekels than
they ask to array the chief of Antiochus' concubines.
To-morrow, if it please you, let Berenice, as the
mistress of the house of Glaucon, receive the ladies
whom you desire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"As you will have it," said he, kissing the hand of
his sister in the latest manner of such etiquette imported
from the capital. "Such spirit as yours,
Deb&mdash;Berenice, is worthy of her who is to outshine
them all."</p>

<h2>XX<br />

<span class="smaller">A FEMALE SYMPOSIUM</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A</span> double awning shielded the house-top
of Glaucon from the glare of the late
afternoon sun, whose rays gathered intensity
by being reflected from a hundred
white domes which, like inverted
wasps' nests, rose from the lower roofs of the city.
Toward the sky the canopy was of coarse white
flaxen material; beneath it was lined with silk, blue
and white. Several movable divans, one of ivory,
one of beaten brass, the others of sycamore wood,
were set next the western parapet. These were covered
with cloths of various colors upon which were
wrought conventional figures in threads of silver
and gold. The couches were so arranged that they
faced a low table of ebony, heavily inlaid with
mother of pearl. On this were the remnants of a repast,
consisting of cakes, confections, fruits, and
wines mixed with water. On the couches reclined
four women, richly clad according to the fashion of
the day.</p>

<p>Cynthia, the wife of General Seron, wore an outer
robe of blue silk. This was closely drawn about
her person, so that the full proportions of bust and
limb were revealed by the very device for their concealment.
It was the boast of Seron that his spouse
was the best-formed woman among the wives of the
generals. Her costume showed that she was conscious
of this pride of her husband, and inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to show that it was fully warranted. Her attitude
as she reclined was that of an Amazon, and would
have been sufficient to warn away any assailant,
even if he were not terrified at the tiny spear of
silver which she held in her fingers, and which had
fastened to her coiffure the hat, a flat disc of ornamented
straw, that now lay in her lap.</p>

<p>The Princess Helena was radiant in the relics of
nature's bountiful endowment, judiciously repaired
by the newest arts of feminine fashion. If wax
and rouge, pencil and pomade were her allies,
they were in slyest ambush within unsuspected
wrinkles, and gave out not so much as a stray
freckle for a sign of the delusion. Her hair was
thrown back from her forehead and temples, and
banded with a triple fillet which gathered it up at
the crown, whence it sprayed down in a shower
of gold upon her alabaster neck. Her outer robe
of white wool had been thrown back, and lay upon
the couch, in seemingly careless, but really artistic,
contrast with her purple chiton. This under-garment
was gathered at the left shoulder within a
gemmed clasp, loosely girded beneath the breasts,
and open below, displaying her limb from foot to
thigh.</p>

<p>Lydia, the wife of Menelaos, the High Priest, had
reason for being more modestly covered, yet blazed
in her green himation spangled with gold.</p>

<p>Deborah, the hostess, rivalled these beauties in the
contrast of her purely oriental costume. Her black
hair was covered with what seemed a solid helmet
of gold, so many were the coins which made her
cap. About her throat and falling low upon her
bosom was a great necklace of rarest gems, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
flashed in all the hues most prized by lapidaries,
from the starry white of diamonds to the deepest
blush of rubies. The pearls pendant from her ears
touched her shoulders, and glowed like rivulets of
light. Her inner garment was elaborately wrought
with needlework, and partly covered with a yellow
outer robe. Altogether the Jewess was a splendid
vision of wealth and beauty, of which it is sufficient
to say that it had already passed the favourable inspection
of so great a connoisseur as her brother
Glaucon.</p>

<p>In their conversation the women seem to have
exhausted all themes of a purely human range&mdash;the
faults of generals, from strategy to bow legs; the
King's stud of horses and his harem; the statuary
of Phidias and the flat-nosed gods of the Ph&oelig;nicians;
the epic of Hesiod, and the latest songs
from the streets of Antioch. Berenice had been induced
to tell her adventures, of which she gave
as authentic an account as perhaps her visitors
gave of their romantic haps and doings on less
savory fields. The glory of the western sky, the
palette of colors ready to be painted together into
the sunset, the grand old Temple mount of the
Jews, over which echoed now and then the bugle-calls
of a hostile race&mdash;these, together with the
quickening influence of their generous repast, now
lifted their discourse to higher planes.</p>

<p>"All religions are one," said Lydia, the wife of
the High Priest. "The Jews should be the first to
recognize this. Since we say that there is one only
living and true God, it surely follows that Jove,
and the Ph&oelig;nicians' Baal, and Ormuzd of the Persians,
and Jehovah of Israel are the same."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"How," interposed the Princess, "how can Jehovah
be Jove, the universal god, since Jehovah
never shows himself, nor is He worshipped, except
in this little land, and by the children of the one
family of Abraham? He is rather like one of our
household gods, such as we teach the children to do
homage to, but ourselves use for ornaments."</p>

<p>"But he has not even an image," laughed Cynthia,
the wife of Seron. "I have learned in Egypt
that the gods always abide near their images."</p>

<p>"That is if they are pretty images, beautifully
carved and painted. For the gods seem to be as vain
as we women who love our mirrors," said Helena.</p>

<p>"But," rejoined Cynthia, "the Jews' god is such a
serious being; always telling his people to be good,
and scolding them for their sins. That story of
Mount Sinai, with its dreary rocks and sands, and
the lightnings with their nest among the peaks, and
caves like great mouths roaring out thunder; oh,
it must be a doleful place! I prefer Mount Olympus,
with its fair women and warriors for divinities."</p>

<p>"And the worship of the Jews' God must be very
tedious," added the Princess. "On the Sabbath, no
laughing, no playing."</p>

<p>"Our God takes his rest on that day, like an old
grandfather, and does not want his children to disturb
his nap," sneered Lydia. "But my good Menelaos
is changing such customs. On Sabbath next
we have the great games. Charicles from Sparta
races with a Nubian chariot runner and an Arab
sheikh, for a stake of ten shekels which the High
Priest has offered. It will be a sight; three statues,
one in marble, one in ebony, and one in porphyry,
all come to life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"The fault of the Jewish religion is that it makes
too little of this world," said the Princess. "It has
no divine patron for the arts; no Melpomene to inspire
the song, no Terpsichore to stir the dance, no
Ares for war, and no Aphrodite to teach us how to
love. I don't believe that our fair hostess, who lies
so solemnly there, has yet learned how to commune
with Aphrodite. I will pray that our happy goddess
touch her lips and make them itch for kisses, before
the crow's feet make their marks at her eyelids, as
they soon will do if she insists on such mannish
escapades as she has been having. What shafts from
Cupid's quiver those black eyes could shoot, my fair
Berenice! I shall warn all my lovers to beware of
you ere you learn your power."</p>

<p>"I fear that just now we need to consult the war
god," said Berenice. "Think you that Ares had gone
wooing the day of the battle in the Wady? Or did
it please his godship to lend his sword to the Maccabæan
rebels rather than to Apollonius?"</p>

<p>"Quick! the Princess is fainting. A little wine, my
dear. The death of her kinsman went to her heart.
That was a cruel thing for Berenice to say," exclaimed
Lydia, bending over her friend.</p>

<p>"I am better now," responded Helena in a moment.
"My dear kinsman, Apollonius, taught me to
bear misfortune. It was his motto, 'Forget the
dead, except to emulate their virtues.' As he braved
death, I must brave my bereavement. I believe with
Plato&mdash;do you not? that the soul is immortal. Then
Apollonius lives. Perhaps I shall see him again."
She hid her face in the cushions.</p>

<p>"Apollonius' death will be quickly avenged," cried
Cynthia. "Already my husband, Seron, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
called to lead the new army, and at one blow he will
utterly extirpate those Jewish beasts. All save
Jerusalem, from the Great Sea to Jordan, is to be
swept with sword. The King has put into my
Seron's hand all the forces in Syria; and following
them is a great multitude of colonists from the
north, who are to settle the lands."</p>

<p>"Where is Seron now?" asked Berenice.</p>

<p>"This letter came to me but three hours since,"
replied Cynthia. "Let me read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'The armies from the capital, joined by many phalanges recalled
from service beyond the Lebanons, are with me. We shall rendezvous
on the plain of Sharon, and thence advance westward to
the hills where the outlaw Judas has his camp. Have no fears,
my love, I am not an Apollonius. We shall this time avoid all
ravines, and march only in the open. The number of soldiers
with me needs neither secrecy nor haste. The peltastai and
cavalry alone could quickly destroy all armed bands of Jews.
We shall consume the land, walled cities, open villages, and scattered
houses, as an army of grasshoppers consumes the harvests.
Not a partridge shall escape our pots, nor a Jew's head our
spear-points. Greet Glaucon with this bit of news&mdash;his friend
Dion is with us, having alone of all his company escaped the
massacre at the Wady. The day after the full moon we begin the
ascent of the hill country. Keep thy dear heart in patience until
the war god rests his head in the lap of love, for I shall be a
day with you in Jerusalem before we press to the East and
South.'"</p></div>

<p>"The moon will be full three nights hence, will it
not?" asked Berenice nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Nay, in two," said Lydia, consulting her tablet.
"It is one of the duties of the High Priest's wife to
wait upon the Night Queen, as does the Priestess of
Tanit. The second night the moon goddess will be
in full array. I must haste to tell the news of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Seron's coming to my Menelaos, that we may have
a religious celebration of the triumph."</p>

<p>"Then must I say farewell so soon to my new
friends?" said Berenice, rising. "Make my salutation
to your good husbands, our friend Menelaos and
General Seron. And to what princely gallant will
the fair Helena convey my greeting?"</p>

<p>"I must keep your greeting all for myself, my dear
Berenice, until time has allayed my grief for Apollonius'
death," replied the Princess. "Unless you bid
me send it on your own account to Captain Dion,"
she added. "Ah, blushes tell tales the lips do not
care to utter."</p>

<p>She kissed both the cheeks of Berenice, but did not
note that her breath blanched the blushes which
Dion's name had started, as frost kills roses.</p>

<p>An hour later Deborah stood beneath the jewelled
lantern in her chamber, for it was now dark. In her
large mirror she saw reflected a figure far different
from that which on the roof had excited the envy of
the vainest of her sex. Her cap of coins, her necklace
and ear-rings, silken robes and bejewelled sandals,
were tossed together in a heap on the floor.</p>

<p>"You can arrange them, Huldah, when I am gone;
and lay them back in the chests."</p>

<p>The old nurse was too much blinded by her tears,
and her hands were too trembling with excitement
to have performed that duty then. She sat on the
floor rocking herself, her hands covering her face.</p>

<p>"My darling came back to me with feet hard and
torn, and in the clouts of a washerwoman, and now
she is going away again like a&mdash;like a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a woman, a woman of Israel," interjected
Deborah, adjusting the brown sheet, the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
coarse outer garment of a peasant, over her head
and around her form.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Huldah, do I not look like you or any
other woman? If I do I am handsome enough for
the stars to gaze at. Now remember, I am supposed
to be sick and confined here in my chamber, and
you are to bring me my broth three times every
day until I really come back. I will think of your
love, Huldah, and that will make me strong; and
you will think of me, and that will bring me back
safely."</p>

<p>She kissed the cheeks of her "good mother" as she
called her, and glided across the court to the entrance
of the cellar. Caleb was already there. They
descended to the lower story.</p>

<p>"What news for me to-night?" said a familiar
voice, accompanied by the click of a crutch on the
stone pavement.</p>

<p>"Why, Meph, you must take me along with you
for your message this time."</p>

<p>"Whew!" said the boy. "You're not really going
yourself, Deborah?"</p>

<p>"Yes; can we reach Judas before morning?"</p>

<p>"If the stars don't get sleepy and go to bed before
their time," replied the lad. "It's a good six hours'
stretch though."</p>

<p>Deborah embraced Caleb, and disappeared with
her guide.</p>

<h2>XXI<br />

<span class="smaller">BATTLE OF BETHHORON</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> sun had long risen the next day
when Deborah came out of a little hut
on the brow of Bethhoron Heights,
several leagues to the northwest of
Jerusalem. It was one of a score of
half-burned and half-demolished structures which
marked the site of a deserted hamlet.</p>

<p>A group of men, who had been lying among the
rocks hard by, rose and silently saluting her
walked away; but not without backward glances
that betokened both reverence and curiosity.</p>

<p>From her high outlook Deborah's eyes took in the
vast plain of Sharon, which lay at her feet. In the
far distance the blue sea mingled with the blue of
the sky; a wonderful background for the nearer
landscape, which seemed like a garden. Yellow
grain-laden fields, patches of variegated poppies and
lilies, vast sections of green meadow, and groves of
fig and orange diminished by distance suggested
parterres of flowers; while the white highways from
C&oelig;le-Syria and the coast seemed but footpaths.
Far to the north the sky was dotted with circling
eagles, while the dust clouds beneath suggested the
fancy that these birds were flying cinders flung upward
by some conflagration.</p>

<p>Deborah put her hand to her brow, and gazed
long in that direction. The dust haze began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
sparkle as with fire-flies. Her trained eyes recognized
the far gleam of spear and helm.</p>

<p>"They come," she ejaculated.</p>

<p>She signalled to an armed peasant near her.
"You are sure that Judas got the message?"</p>

<p>"I myself delivered it, my lady. Already our little
army is on its way northward. By night
they will guard every road leading up from the
plain; and then, themselves kept out of sight, they
will follow southward and strike any detachment of
the Greeks that ventures to ascend the hills. But
Judas must believe that they will not attempt any
ascent until they get as far down as this, for Simon
and John are hard by, and examining every slope
and runway along the front of Bethhoron."</p>

<p>Later in the day the astute surmise of Judas was
demonstrated to have been correct. As Deborah
watched, she plainly distinguished the detachments
of the Syrian hosts succeed one another in their
southerly movement, like billows of grain under a
strong breeze. When night fell the plain of Sharon
right before her gleamed with camp-fires, as the sea
with phosphorescence; while on every side she heard
the rustle of the moving bands of her countrymen,
together with the subdued voices of command. But
not a light glowed on the brow of Bethhoron.</p>

<p>Late in the night Judas came to her.</p>

<p>"My child, you should not be here. It was enough
to have sent us word."</p>

<p>"I could not remain in the city," replied Deborah,
"for I clearly foresee that to-morrow we shall have
a great victory, which the Lord will give us, or else
we shall be utterly destroyed."</p>

<p>"But here you are in danger," responded Judas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
"I beg you to return to the city. If we succeed we
shall soon join you there. If we are destroyed the
Lord will raise up others to avenge us, for His cause
rests with no single army. He is the Lord of Hosts,
and will fill our places with better men. You must
live to be for them what you have been for us. It
is enough that we die."</p>

<p>"Nay, Judas, entreat me not. The daughter of
Elkiah will meet the fate of the sons of Mattathias.
It is my father's spirit that speaks through my lips.
I shall seek no danger, but I must cheer our brave
brothers, and staunch their wounds or close their
eyes in death. Do not think me rebellious, but to
this duty I am surely called by Him who commands
us both."</p>

<p>"I dare not command you, Deborah, for you are
closer to God than I, and know His will more perfectly.
But this thing meets not my judgment.
Only do not follow the men over the heights. Yet I
think we shall succeed on the morrow. General
Seron is making a mistake as clearly as did Apollonius.
When his host attempts to pass over Bethhoron
it must keep to the highway. With his horsemen
and armament he cannot climb the ledges, nor
can his footmen march through the tangles of brush
and swamp. They must follow the zigzagging of the
road, and move in a long and twisting file like a
string crumpled in one's hand. His line may be
twenty furlongs in length, but it will all be within
five furlongs' reach of us. Our men can cross these
thickets and stone fields as swallows skim the
ground. Behind the rocks and brushwood one of
our archers will have a score for his target. Besides,
we will have the advantage of fighting from higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
ground. I have no fear. Our onslaught will be sudden;
they have as yet no dream of opposition. One
is tempted to make a night attack upon their camp.
But it is better to wait; for, if I mistake not, to-morrow
they will move up the Heights like a line of
captives to the headsman's block. Yonder is the
valley of Ajalon, above which the sun stood still
until Joshua had gotten the victory. Pray with us,
Deborah, that the sun may not set to-morrow until
we too have been victorious. If the sun will not
lengthen the day for us, we will so crowd it with
valorous deeds that we shall make it like many days
in one. Farewell! Do not venture beyond the
Heights."</p>

<p>Before noon of the following day, the advance of
Seron's troops was well up the ascent by the winding
road, in exactly the order which Judas had anticipated.
For miles the army stretched away, almost
to Lydda; the glare of clustered spear-heads showing
like the golden spots on a python. In places detachments
which were far removed from one another
in the marching order were brought close together
by the loops of the road, while intervening fields of
boulders separated them, so that they were not in
helpful proximity.</p>

<p>But no danger was visible to the Greeks. Helmets
were thrown off and piled on wagons with the baggage.
There were songs in which the men from one
province tried to drown the voices of men from
other parts of the King's realm with their strange
melodies. The only precaution shown was by the
very foremost of the army of invaders, who, obeying
their General's order of discipline, sent out scouts.
These threaded their way slowly between the boul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>ders
near the crest of Bethhoron; leisurely feasting
themselves upon the berries which glowed blue and
red at their fingers.</p>

<p>One closely watching these scouts and pickets
would have noted that when a Greek soldier surmounted
the crest he neither returned nor made
sign to those following. He simply disappeared, his
comrades supposing that he had passed in safety.
But an eagle flying over the spot would have paused
to hover, with beak parted for the carrion feast
that awaited him there; for behind the ledge were
masked the deadliest shots among the Jewish bowmen,
and those most expert with the short lance,
having from boyhood used it in hunting. Men who
could elude the sagacity of the fox, and pin the
wary beast to the ground with a throw of threescore
paces, made quick finish of a Greek armed with
a long and heavy sarissa, which was fit only for
close prodding.</p>

<p>Behind the van came the staff of Seron, men bemedalled
for exploits in many battles. Then followed
squadrons of horse, crowding their sweaty
flanks, and rubbing the greaves from their riders'
legs in the attempt to keep full number abreast on
the narrow road. So the python's head reached the
Heights of Bethhoron.</p>

<p>Suddenly the crest of the hill burst as with an
earthquake. A roar as of thunder articulated the
war cry, "Mi-camo-ca-ba!" Every rock scintillated
with spear-heads. Arrows clouded the air, and fell
in deadly showers upon the unshielded Greeks, leaving
scarcely a man or a horse standing on the near
roadway. Hundreds of these shafts, as if borne by
wings, so far was their flight, dropped amid Seron's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
suite, and the gayest plumes first nodded beneath
the deadly challenge.</p>

<p>Under cover of this storm of missiles, and before
the enemy could sufficiently recover from consternation
to clearly discern the meaning of the attack, the
armored Jews dashed over the crest. As when a
dam bursts, the living flood poured down the slope,
carrying everything before it. Mi-camo-ca-ba! the
wild cry from a thousand throats, drowned all
shouts of command. But one sound was heard
above the din. It was the lion voice of Judas, as
with the sword of Apollonius he hewed his way
through the half-formed phalanges. The first stretch
of road was not cleared of the foe before those on
the second bend were hemmed in by the patriot
archers, who had gained the covert of rocks on
either side, and swept the highway with unerring
aim. For the Greeks to advance was impossible;
orderly retreat equally vain. Those who stood their
ground were huddled together as for quicker slaughter.
Those in the rear turned backward in flight.
The splendid squadrons, blinded by panic, became
like herds of riderless horses, spurred by the sting of
arrows. Cavalry dashed back upon the infantry
following, carrying these foot soldiers along as a
freshet its débris. In less than two hours the army
of Seron was in hopeless rout over the white hills
and across the green cornfields of the plain of
Sharon.</p>

<p>The Maccabæans did not follow in pursuit. To
have done so would have revealed to the enemy the
fewness of their assailants. Should the Greeks regain
their wits and resume the fight, Judas foresaw
that his men, away from their coverts of rocks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
copses and in the open plain, would be readily annihilated
by superior numbers. He let the panic do
its work.</p>

<p>"It's the angel of the Lord," he said, "though his
wings are black with God's curse."</p>

<p>So Judas was content to watch the writhing of
the python whose head he had crushed.</p>

<p>Seron and the survivors of his staff displayed
their genius by escaping in the opposite direction
to the retreat of the mass of the army. They turned
off from the highway, and crossed the fields toward
the southeast in the direction of Jerusalem, their
only covert now. Several of the horses of his suite
were abandoned, having broken their legs as they
slipped between the rocks; others refused to enter
the thickets of underbrush which had already torn
their flesh, until they were unmercifully prodded by
the spurs of their riders. A handful of officers at
length struck a hoof path that with many windings
debouched into the highway near the summit
of Bethhoron, whence they made their way toward
the city.</p>

<h2>XXII<br />

<span class="smaller">A PRELUDE WITHOUT THE PLAY</span></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> day had been one of intensest excitement
in the city of Jerusalem. From
earliest morning the population had
poured out of the gates, and gathered
on the high ground to the north that
they might welcome Seron and his host.</p>

<p>It was remembered that on this spot years ago,
according to the stories the rabbis told, Alexander
the Great had been received by the people of the
city. He, too, had ascended from Sharon by the
pass of Bethhoron. Now, in the steps of the mightiest
of world-conquerors, as Cynthia proudly noted,
was to come the great Seron.</p>

<p>The High Priest, Menelaos, had arranged a ceremony
copied as nearly as might be from the legends
of Alexander's visit. He himself was dressed in full
pontifical robes of purple and gold, as were the ancient
priests of Israel, except that the name of Jehovah
no longer shone on the gold plate of his turban.
The supreme pontiff was followed by scores
of men, most of them Greeks, dressed for the occasion
as common priests in white robes, which glistened
as if the bright morning light were itself a part
of the pageant. There were musicians with trumpets
and cymbals to beat the very atmosphere into
melodious salutation, and clacquers to shout and
cheer the oration which Menelaos should pronounce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
as he invoked the blessings of all the gods upon the
head of the advancing chieftain.</p>

<p>After this official procession came a double palanquin,
bearing the wives of Menelaos and Seron;
and upon their persons, if one might judge by the
gorgeousness of the display, was much of the movable
wealth of their spouses.</p>

<p>The Princess Helena, too, shone radiantly. Her
complexion, the triumph of cosmetics, rivalled the
white but ruddy skin of the children who ran beside
her and gazed at her beauty. Her light hair
was star lit with jewels, and wrought into a high
coiffure not unlike a miniature sheaf of wheat with
a binder of gold. She reclined upon the cushions in
graceful lassitude, and nodded her head at each
stride of the carriage-bearers with the dignity of
one who felt that she had already made her conquest
of the world, and would graciously encourage
the coming warriors in making theirs.</p>

<p>Yet there was on the face of the Princess a shadow
of disappointment as she gave her patronizing recognition
to one and another of the élite passing by.
She was reserving her graciousness for Glaucon, one
of whose ancestral gems shone brilliantly upon her
bosom. The announced illness of Berenice left her
coquetry this day an open field; for, in spite of
her flattery, she had conceived a distrust of the sister
of her paramour. There was to her mind a strangely
familiar look about Berenice's face, a flitting suggestion
of something she had seen and ought to remember,
but could not. Helena believed in the
transmigration of souls, or sometimes thought she
did. Was Berenice's spirit one that had crossed her
path in some previous state of existence? She could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
not determine whether the shadowy reminiscences
were real or fanciful; nor, if real, whether they were
pleasant or otherwise. She said to herself, "This
feeling is foolish," but Berenice's presence always
awakened the feeling. So she fell back upon a bit of
philosophy she had once heard from a noted rhetorician,
"There is an instinctive hostility between some
souls, and an instinctive love between other souls,
with either of which the intelligent judgment has
little to do."</p>

<p>But Glaucon did not join the gay throng. Did his
sister's illness so concern him? The Princess felt a
flash of jealousy mantle her face, and knowing from
the frequent lesson learned at her mirror that it did
not make her handsome, she toyed with Glaucon's
gem until more pleasing thoughts came.</p>

<p>Toward midday the crowd of watchers on the hill
noted a cloud of dust rising above the road from
Bethhoron. It swirled like that raised by a whirlwind.
It came rapidly nearer and larger. At length
the cry broke from the crowd:</p>

<p>"The army comes! Seron! Seron!"</p>

<p>Forth moved the multitude. The company of
priests led, the white linen garments of the old
régime marred by garlands worn in imitation of the
revellers at the Bacchanalian rites. Men bore an
altar of the war god Ares, and a jar of wine, with
a great goblet of gold from which the oblation
should be poured. Behind these marched the city
guards, in glistening helm and breastplates and
greaves, the least among whom seemed to emulate
the war god himself with his pompous tread. Then
came the palanquins of the noble women, each a
gorgeous display of silken colors, suitable to set off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the glory of the occupants. Behind followed, as they
could find way, the multitude, whose gay attire
rivalled in its variegation the plumage of an aviary
of birds caught among the reeds of the Red Sea
shore.</p>

<p>The crowd halted when they clearly detected a
group of Greek horsemen spurring hard along the
road. Why were they riding so hard? As they came
near they were seen to be without helmet or spear
or heavy sword; dust-covered and bleeding; on
jaded beasts whose flecks of sweaty foam interlaced
the tatters of their once gorgeous harness. On they
sped in blind flight, trampling their way through the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Back! Back to the city!" shouted the officers.
"The Maccabæans are close upon us!"</p>

<p>"Stop, my lord! Stop, my lord Seron!" cried
Cynthia, as the General was hurrying by.</p>

<p>The sight of his wife revived the remnant of this
great man's wits, which the panic had sadly dissipated.
Making himself the special attendant of her
palanquin, he set an example of celerity by heading
the scurrying crowd. He commanded Dion with his
handful of soldiers to guard the rear.</p>

<p>That officer quite leisurely performed his duty,
lingering alone far behind the multitude, and anon
riding back as if seeking again to join the battle.
This was not because he was enamored of the fight;
but as he was climbing Bethhoron Dion had caught
sight of a woman in peasant garb bending over a
wounded Jew. He had nearly ridden them down.
The woman, seeing the danger, rose and with uplifted
hand warned him away. A woman's hand
only, but the steed would have refused to leap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
against it had the rider plunged the spurs to their
depth. There are some gestures and attitudes that
belong to the soul, and express its dominance over
all things of flesh and blood. Dion could not catch
the woman's face, but that very pose with the
uplifted hand had awed him before this. He had
seen it at the gateway of the house of Elkiah, and
again amid the ruins of the house of Ben Isaac.</p>

<p>But he had no time to connect his thoughts, for
at the moment a sling stone struck his helmet, and
drove it down upon his neck. When he had adjusted
his headpiece his horse had carried him far beyond
the spot.</p>

<p>Then he said: "It was only imagination; when
one's head rings as mine did with that stone, the
thoughts inside are apt to rattle too."</p>

<p>Dion remembered that he had often had visions of
that same woman in some form. In all the march
down the plain of Sharon he had thought of her as
somewhere among those hills. When in the battle he
felt the sharp sting of an arrow which grazed his
thigh, he found himself asking the question, "Would
she care if I fell?" Now, as he looked back toward
Bethhoron, he said: "This was only a spectre of my
imagination." Yet he would risk his life to see that
spectre again. But Dion obeyed his General's orders,
and plodded slowly after him. His head dropped
upon his breast, and he scarcely noticed a boy with
a crutch who struck at his horse's flank and hobbled
away.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GREED OF GLAUCON</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-g.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Glaucon</span> had not gone out with the
crowd to welcome General Seron. His
curiosity for the pageant and his fascination
by the Princess were just then
secondary to his cupidity. This native
trait in his character had been excited into spasmodic
activity by a certain discovery. He had spent the
day before searching the mansion of Ben Shattuck,
that grand house by the Tower of David. With the
avidity of an old-clothes dealer he had ransacked
chests of the cast-off wearing apparel of dead generations
of Shattucks, now and then perforating with
his fingers the moth-eaten linings of pockets and
pouches. He had tested drawers for false bottoms,
and pried into secret closets between walls which the
mortar, cracked by sinking beams, had exposed. He
had been rewarded by a handful of forgotten gems,
but more by a crumpled bit of papyrus in a leathern
wallet which he found in the bosom pocket of the
shirt which Ben Shattuck must have discarded the
very day of his departure from Jerusalem, the journey
from which he never returned. This was a letter
and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To <span class="smcap">Hosea ben Shattuck</span>, greeting:</p>

<p>"The business committed to my care has been, I believe, both
faithfully and wisely adjusted. It were better for the trade between
Sidon and this port if you resided either here or there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
There is another reason for your speedy visit, if not abiding
sojourn, in Alexandria. The lady to whom I hold that you
were legally wedded has given birth to a son. The little lad is
sound of limb, of comely face, and, if the midwife's experience
pronounce good judgment, the child is of soul as bright as the
star that shone the night of his birth.</p>

<p>"I beg that you endeavor to be in Alexandria the eighth day
hence, when the child will be circumcised according to our sacred
rite.</p>

<p>"I am the faithful servant of the house of Shattuck,</p>

<p class="right">
"GIDEON BEN SIRACH."
</p></div>

<p>The discovery that an heir of Shattuck had been
born complicated the matter of title to his estate in
Jerusalem. Was this child living? If so, he would
now be about the thirtieth year of life. Glaucon
spent the day in instructing a faithful envoy, and
commissioning him to Alexandria to ferret out the
facts.</p>

<p>This messenger had scarcely gained the south road
leading to Gaza when the crowds of panic-driven
citizens burst through the northern and western
gates, some going to their houses, but many hastening
to the citadel, deeming the city walls too weak
to withstand the Maccabæan deluge they imagined
to be pouring after them.</p>

<p>The bewilderment of Seron, and his declaration
that his defeat was brought about by unearthly
agencies, which neither generalship nor numbers
could resist, while designed to save his own reputation,
added to the consternation of the people.
Renegade Jews began to repent of their apostacy.
They increased the alarm of the foreigners by the
sudden revival of their own faith in the marvels of
Jewish history, and their Scriptural accounts of the
waves of the Red Sea, and the magic in the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of Aaron and Hur when they upheld the arms of
Moses. Frightened credulity saw the afternoon
shadows that day grow shorter instead of longer,
as they did at the battle of Ajalon in Joshua's time.
Some averred that at nightfall the sun, as if to
make up for lost time, made a sudden plunge to his
setting, splashing the waves of the Great Sea until
like billows of blood they mingled with those of fire
along the horizon.</p>

<p>The disastrous issue of the battle led Glaucon to
seek the secret closets in his own house, to conceal
in them his riches of coins and jewels, and certain
papers which would be more honored in Antioch
than in Jerusalem, if the Maccabæans should
enter. One such hiding-place he knew was in the
cellar. He had never opened it. From a lad he had
avoided dark places. Yet he thought he knew how to
distinguish the spot. It was the fourth stone from
the corner nearest the steps. He had often heard it
spoken of as the "trap." He felt his own pallor as
he descended the steps; but a chill that made his
flesh sensitively shrivel seized him when he lifted this
stone, for a damp air like the breath of ghosts issued
from the opening. Summoning all his courage, he
thrust his trembling hands down, feeling for alcoves
or shelves in the hollow dark space. Suddenly his
timid nerves failed him. There was a subterranean
sound; a rustling as of winding-sheets; footfalls
soft and muffled, such as ghosts might make. He
would probably have fainted had not his greed
given him strength. Clutching his bags he glided
away like a frightened lizard.</p>

<p>A few moments later voices came out of the hole.</p>

<p>"It is strange," said Caleb, "I smelt a light."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"I, too, thought I saw a gleam," said Deborah.
"But, surely, I lowered the stone when I came down
the other day. Have you raised it since?"</p>

<p>"I was down but once while you were away,"
replied the lad, "and I know I closed it, for see!
here I pinched my finger in setting the great stone
back."</p>

<p>"It was too heavy for you, child. You should not
have come down here," replied Deborah.</p>

<p>"But I could not stay in the house, and you out
of it, sister; so I went through the quarries and
whistled for Meph at the wall, but he didn't come;
I played all day in the caverns."</p>

<p>"What a place to play, my child."</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't see how bad it was, so I didn't
care."</p>

<p>Caleb led the way up from the cellar. Huldah,
who had waited and listened for signs of her coming,
held Deborah in her motherly arms, and dropped
upon her face some tears well salted with memories
of by-gone years.</p>

<h2>XXIV<br />

<span class="smaller">LESSONS IN DIPLOMACY</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the excitement of the great disaster no
one had inquired for Deborah, except
Glaucon, who received from the cautious
Huldah evasive replies regarding
her illness. The day following the battle
her brother insisted upon seeing her, since it
might be necessary to make sudden flight in the
event of the Maccabæans attacking the city.</p>

<p>Deborah came from her chamber, walking with
difficulty. One would have said that she had received
a hurt or a wound from a fall. She, however,
spoke slightingly of the pain in the sinews which
sometimes came to her, an inherited disorder; at
least she had heard that her mother was at times
similarly attacked; but a few days' rest always
cured her. She now listened with surprise to the
story that a great battle had taken place, and upbraided
Glaucon and Huldah and Ephraim for not
telling her of it. She questioned every new-comer
with the eagerness of fright. Each fresh outcry in
the street seemed to deepen the blanch of her cheeks,
so that even Glaucon, though his face was pale and
his lips trembled, rebuked her timidity, and swore
great heathen oaths, such as befitted so valiant a
protector.</p>

<p>"What shall we do if the rebels really take the
city?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We will flee to Antioch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the Jews hold all the country to the north,
do they not?"</p>

<p>"If the worst comes we can take ship at Gaza. I
have got as much gold as my belt will hold, and
our asses are ready to start at daybreak, if the
news then warrants our flight. But who comes?"</p>

<p>Through the uproar in the street were heard cries
of the name of Dion. The curtains moved, and the
young Captain stood at the opening.</p>

<p>Glaucon's welcome was enthusiastic. He embraced
his friend, and kissed him upon both cheeks. The
Greek did not return the salutation. He seemed
dazed, and stared steadily over Glaucon's shoulder.
Had he indeed gone daft? After gazing at a sunset
one is apt to see golden spots resembling the orb
wherever one looks at the sky. Had Deborah
wrought a similar illusion on his imagination? He
had seen her in his dreams, both waking and sleeping;
among the women of the Greek camp at the
Wady; and only yesterday in peasant garb amid the
dying on Bethhoron&mdash;yet she was here in her home!
He was beginning to question his own mental condition.
His hand came to his head as if to certify
that it was still upon his shoulders. Deborah
quickly proved that this time at least she was no
sprite out of the foam of fancy. With a suppressed
cry of surprise and gladness she sprang to meet him.
He would have been less than a man if he had not
extended both hands to embrace her. To her glorious
womanhood was added the frank joyousness of
a child. Her face caught the flash of her soul, and
was illumined by it.</p>

<p>This was, however, but for the instant. The next
moment she drew back. Her face flushed, then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>came
of marble pallor. Dignity, hauteur, offence,
almost scorn were written upon her brow and lips.
It was as if a bursting rose-bush were suddenly encased
in wintry ice.</p>

<p>Deborah realized that the surprise of Dion's coming
had thrown her off her guard. Had she not
solemnly determined, that night at the Wady, that
henceforth they two could have nothing in common?
This had been a conviction of her judgment and of
her sense of duty. That hour when she had used a
woman's wiles to accomplish a higher purpose she
had classed among her other practices of deceit as a
spy. She had scorned herself for it. Now that her
debt for his risking life in her behalf had been fully
paid&mdash;paid off by her risking her loyalty to her
country to save him&mdash;she had accustomed herself to
think of him only as an enemy; a Greek, either hating
the Jews and therefore persecuting them, or else
a mere soldier of fortune, indifferent to all right and
truth, as unfeeling as the point of his sword. In the
one case he was a man whom she, as a Jewess,
must treat as a foe; in the other case, he was a
man of such character that she, as a woman, must
despise him. She had resolved that if ever they did
meet&mdash;and she prayed God that they might not&mdash;it
should be with such frigid courtesy on her part that
former relations could not be resumed. She had
thought, too, that she could readily play this part.
Had she not schooled herself to absolute self-control?
Who could see through any mask she pleased to
wear? Not the shrewdest of the Greek generals in
whose tents she had been; not the suspicious eyes of
these women in Jerusalem. She had prided herself
that, whatever feeling might linger in her heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
her personality was buried within her patriot purpose.</p>

<p>Yet just now her impulse on seeing this man had
been as uncontrolled as that of a child. What had
she done? She said: "I have betrayed myself."
Then she asked a deeper question on this line than
she had ever asked before: "How could I betray
myself? Am I not my own very self? Is there, then,
some deeper self with which I am not fully acquainted?
And is it true that that deeper, stranger
self, having never been consulted, has never consented
to the judgment I had formed regarding Dion?"</p>

<p>She began to feel, what the Princess believed, that
there is a mysterious sense of kinship between certain
souls which asserts itself in spite of conditions,
which heeds no warning of judgment, and refuses
submission to other passions. If it were not so,
why had Dion's sudden coming made her do that
which no other surprise could have led her to do&mdash;make
her forget herself?</p>

<p>But in a moment more she had recovered her self-possession.
She bowed Dion to a seat as coldly as
any stranger might have done, and bade him tell
the story of the battle.</p>

<p>Captain Dion addressed himself solely to Glaucon,
for each glance at Deborah seemed to interrupt his
memory of events. Once and again he stopped midway
a sentence as he looked at her, until Glaucon
recalled him by repeating his last words.</p>

<p>At length, fixing his eyes steadily upon her face,
he said:</p>

<p>"We were defeated because we had on our side no&mdash;prophetess&mdash;to
inspire us to more than human
valor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>But Deborah was now on her guard. That play
on Dion's part belonged to diplomacy, not sentiment,
and she rewarded his ruse by not so much as
a quivering eyelash or the shadow of a changing
hue.</p>

<p>"Do the armies take prophetesses to their battlefields?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"The Greeks do not," replied Dion. "Such holy
women as we have remain at home and consult the
entrails and stars. But it was reported that the
Jews were accompanied by some of theirs. I overheard
one say, 'The prophetess, the Daughter of
Jerusalem, is with us.'"</p>

<p>His eyes searched hers, but could discover no sign
that she understood his deeper meaning.</p>

<p>The diplomatic play between Dion and Deborah
was like the sword play of two expert fencers whose
blades cling together. Glaucon unwittingly relieved
the tension by inquiring:</p>

<p>"As a soldier, do you advise my leaving the city,
Captain Dion?"</p>

<p>"I as a soldier, or you as a soldier? Which do
you mean?" laughed the Captain.</p>

<p>"I am not a soldier," said Glaucon. "My position
of influence is too great for me to take such risks."</p>

<p>"If you were a soldier," said Dion, "I would advise
you to make your house a castle, and die behind
your parapets. But no, I think that one with
so many other interests had better take refuge in the
citadel or at Antioch. The fact is, our forces have
been utterly overthrown. The Jews are in pursuit
through the plain. Judas, I think, camped in our
camps at Lydda last night. But he will return; and
if he strikes us here we have not sufficient soldiers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
guard the entire walls. We can hold no more than
the citadel."</p>

<p>"Then I will gather up all I can, and to-morrow
have it removed to the Tower of David," replied the
frightened man.</p>

<p>"I commend your discretion," said the soldier, as
Glaucon, summoning his steward, left the apartment.</p>

<span class="smaller">A JEWESS TAKES NO ORDERS FROM THE ENEMY</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">"And</span> you, Captain?" said Deborah, with
as much coolness as courtesy when
they were alone. "You will pardon
my seeming lack of hospitality, for you
know that you are ever welcome at
the house of Elkiah; but should you not return to
your duty? The riot in the street needs a strong
control. And are you not under orders from General
Seron?"</p>

<p>"The General has forgotten what orders he has
given," replied Dion. "Or, if he remembers them, he
will have to enforce them with a new army from
Sheol, for Seron has fled thither. It was bravely
done, but terrible. The General has already taken
the only vengeance that remained for his defeat. He
has washed out his dishonor in his own blood. We
had scarcely entered the citadel when he turned to
me and said, 'Dion, this disgrace I shall never live to
hear told. Do as I do.' With that he struck his
dagger to the heart of his wife, then fell himself
upon his sword point. I did not obey his order. I
was too cowardly for that."</p>

<p>Dion hesitated before he continued:</p>

<p>"But no, I was not cowardly. Deborah, since
what has passed between us, I owe to you the confession
of my only reason for not following my
leader in his terrible deed. I thought of one very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
dear to me, from whom I seemed to have been
separated by long years, so slow did the time creep
in her absence&mdash;now among a people foreign to me.
To this woman I had once bound myself with a
vow."</p>

<p>Deborah felt the blood coming to her cheeks.</p>

<p>Dion kept on: "While this woman lives, I must
live, unless she bids me die. But if she shall call
me coward I will disprove her words by dying at
her feet. Does the daughter of Elkiah bid me follow
my General? I will obey. Since the turn of affairs
at Bethhoron you will no longer need one of hated
race to protect you. As your Jehovah is my judge,
Deborah, I have lived for naught else since I felt the
touch of your hand at the Wady. I await your
word."</p>

<p>How much one can live in a moment! The two
preceding years lay there in Deborah's memory like
a landscape under the lightning. She saw this man
in his sacrificial friendship. She thought that she
resented his personal affection; but, that being
eliminated, he was the noblest of souls: a Greek,
yet respecting her nation's faith even by the altar
in the Temple where he raised his protest in the
endeavor to protect her dying father; defending this
house because it was a home; more tender to her
Caleb than his own brother had been. She asked
herself, "Could even Judas have shown nobler manhood?
Would he befriend a household of his enemies
whose only claim should be their piteous need?"</p>

<p>With all hauteur gone, she extended her hand and
said:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Captain Dion! I have wronged you.
I have been blind! I am blind still!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>She thought she had looked him frankly in the
face, and that she had pronounced these words very
calmly; she was unaware that she had blushed, that
tears came into her eyes, and that her hand trembled
in his.</p>

<p>Dion was more astute. Like an expert soldier he
detected the favorable turn affairs had taken at this
critical juncture, and sought words to press his advantage.
But before he could speak Deborah had
lapsed into reserve. Was it her woman's pride that
felt somewhat of resentment? or was it the remnant
of her former resolution which came as a forlorn
hope to her rescue? She said:</p>

<p>"You, sir, should be with your soldiers; and I&mdash;I
have much to think of."</p>

<p>"But pledge me, Deborah, that you will not go
again to the army."</p>

<p>At this she stood erect and haughty, as a captive
queen before her captor might have done. She
forced severity into her tone:</p>

<p>"I am a Jewess, sir, and must not take orders
from the enemy."</p>

<p>"I do not command, I entreat," replied Dion.
"By your own God, Deborah, I swear to you that
the slaughter of all the King's host is less to me
than that harm should come to a hair of your
head."</p>

<p>"A very pretty speech," rejoined Deborah, with
simulated sarcasm, "but it is scarcely a speech befitting
a Greek soldier. Is your faith like a helmet
which can be changed at will, that you can swear
by a stranger's god?"</p>

<p>"My faith! My faith!" exclaimed Dion. "We
Greeks have no such faith as yours. But a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
faith have I&mdash;that all gods are one, or rather, as
your heroism has made me feel, that one God is all.
The God of Israel is the God of all nations. That
you have taught me. I have found my prophetess,
if Israel has none."</p>

<p>"It is the true faith," said Deborah, "but how
should you know it? Is a girl's belief more to you
than all your boasted philosophy?"</p>

<p>"Not a girl's belief, but a woman's life," cried the
Greek enthusiastically. "A life filled with the spirit
of her God, is most convincing. That has persuaded
me. And yet, Deborah, these thoughts are
not altogether new to me. From childhood I seem
to have had something of this faith. Voices have
spoken to me from an unknown world&mdash;a world
over this, as the sky domes all lands and seas.
Our Greek gods are to this God of yours as the
bright things about us are to the sun. Though the
sun's face be hidden by clouds all things get their
brightness from it. And strangely, these voices I
speak of seem to be recalling me to something I had
once known and forgotten, or to awaken something
born in me, but still latent and unintelligible. Your
father's clear faith, your own words, your devotion&mdash;these
have been an interpreter of what I have so
vaguely felt. Believe me, Deborah, I commit no
sacrilege when I swear my devotion to the God of
Israel."</p>

<p>Deborah listened with a delight not concealed by
her expression of wonderment.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said eagerly, "tell me more of
yourself, Captain Dion. I pray you be seated. Did
not your father have something of this faith? Else
who has taught you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"My father I have hardly known," replied Dion.
"He was attached to the court of Philip of Macedonia.
When I was but seven years old he was sent
on an embassage to Rome, and never returned to
us. My mother had died four years before. Of her
I have but dim remembrance, or perhaps fancied
remembrance, prompted by this."</p>

<p>He produced from his breast a small box enclosing
a beautiful face carved in relief upon ivory, and delicately
enriched with flesh tints.</p>

<p>"This was the work of an Athenian who was
greatly skilled in such art. This face has ever been
in my thoughts. No other face of woman ever displaced
it from my constant dream by day and by
night, until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak no more of that," said Deborah. "Let no
stranger supplant your mother's image in your
love."</p>

<p>"At my father's death," resumed Dion, "I was
made a page in the household of Perseus, who succeeded
Philip, until I was strong enough to carry a
sword. Since then the camp has been my home. I
fought for my King until he was utterly overthrown
by the Romans; then I became a wanderer. Hoping
that Antiochus would war against my old enemy
the Romans, I gave him my sword. I did not seek
such work as we have done here. But enough about
myself. Pledge me, Deborah, that you will not go
again to the army."</p>

<p>"Again to the army?" exclaimed Deborah. "Why,
when you found me at the Wady, did you not entreat
me to return to my home here? And have I
not done so?"</p>

<p>"And it was well," replied Dion. "But it was said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that at the fight yesterday, the daughter of Elkiah
encouraged the Jews. Your name was heard
shouted like a battle cry by the Maccabæans."</p>

<p>"My name!" said Deborah, in well-feigned amazement.
"Captain Dion, surely that bruise on your
brow tells of some more serious blow you must have
received, to have imagined that you heard my name.
And have you not found me here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can give the lie to the rumor about your
being in the battle; and I will swear by Jehovah
and all the gods, that I know to the contrary, if the
story should ever be repeated to your injury among
the people of the city."</p>

<p>"Do not swear it, Dion. If you believe in our
God, keep His commandment which says, 'Thou
shalt not take the Name of God in vain,' and for a
Greek to swear as you propose to do would surely
be in vain."</p>

<h2>XXVI<br />

<span class="smaller">TO UNMASK THE PRINCESS</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> panic in Jerusalem soon gave place
to a sense of security. This was due
not only to the fact that the Maccabæans
had not followed up their victory
and attacked the city, but also in
large measure to the quieting counsel of Captain
Dion.</p>

<p>"The defeat at Bethhoron," he declared, "was
owing not to any superior force of the Jews, but to
the folly of General Seron in marching his army so
as to invite assault. Indeed, when the forward
phalanges recoiled upon those coming after, the
Greeks defeated themselves. That disaster might
have occurred had no enemy attacked us. But the
force that Judas has, while sufficient to start a panic
by its sudden irruption under such circumstances, is
too small to attempt the capture of the city. His
men are only peasants, and without armaments of
siege. Upon the walls one man could withstand
many assailants; and from within the citadel a
woman might resist a company of men. Beside
this, intelligence has come that Lysias, the new
Governor, has despatched our most noted generals,
Ptolemy, Nicanor, and Gorgias, with a force of forty
thousand footmen and seven thousand horse to
utterly exterminate the Maccabæans. If the rebels
elude our new armies, it will be only by leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Judea, and taking refuge across the Jordan in the
mountains of Moab, where they will be as harmless to
Jerusalem as are the beasts which infest those wilds."</p>

<p>Under such counsel the people were calmed. As
the terrible Judas did not appear at the gate of the
city&mdash;nor, as some imagined, like a bat as big as a
cloud, scale the walls with armed men under his
wings&mdash;life resumed its usual course among the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The reaction from fright did not even stop with a
general sense of security. The pleasure-loving people
sought to recompense their days of abstinence by
extravagant indulgence.</p>

<p>In this they were charmingly led by the Princess
Helena, whose grief for Apollonius had been completely
healed, if rumor were correct, by the attentions
of Glaucon. The enamored man had purchased
her favor by a relinquishment to her of his interest
in the estate of Shattuck. This transaction, told by
Helena in confidence to Lydia, had come to the
knowledge of her husband Menelaos, the High Priest,
who, claiming to be partner with the renegade Jew
in all ventures that paid, insisted upon Glaucon's
turning over to him, as through former agreement,
one-half the estimated prospective value of the estate.
An open breach between the two men was
prevented by a stroke of business shrewdness manipulated
by the two women. Glaucon was induced to
repurchase the claim by payment to the Princess of
a sum of ready money; which money, it is needless
to say, was shared by that gracious lady with the
High Priest himself, who still retained his half interest
in the Shattuck property.</p>

<p>Glaucon was readily reconciled to his loss through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
this deal, not only by the affectionate rewards of his
mistress, but by new discoveries relative to the estate
of Shattuck. Its value was greater than he had
at first surmised, embracing heavy mortgages upon
adjacent property.</p>

<p>All this time Glaucon's relations with the Princess
were an offense to Deborah which, with all her art,
she could scarcely conceal. She must tear the fair
veil from this hideous creature. But how could she
do so without confessing her own double life, since
it was in the spy's disguise she had discovered all
that she really knew of the woman? In her remonstrances
with Glaucon she dared not go beyond
interrogations and insinuations, which her brother
resented with warmth.</p>

<p>"If we have not known her, others have," said he.
"Her coming to meet Apollonius in Samaria was an
event in the camp."</p>

<p>"And excited no scandal?"</p>

<p>"Scandal? Hera, the wife and sister of Jove, did
not escape the taunt of tongues. The fairer the
flower the fouler the insect that stings it. You
yourself, Berenice, have had unsavory things said of
you; but who would believe them?"</p>

<p>"Still," interposed Deborah, "you know for a certainty
nothing about her lineage."</p>

<p>"She has told me all," replied Glaucon. "The
blood of the great Alexander is in her veins, mingled
with that of the Ptolemies. But do you not see her
royalty in her very look and form and manner?
The gods do not make such caskets except for priceless
gems."</p>

<p>"The hetæræ of Greece are the fairest women,"
suggested Deborah, with a tone of contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"But have you not seen how choice she is in the
selection of her friends?" argued he. "In Jerusalem
she receives to her intimacy only those of the most
dignified position, like the house of Menelaos&mdash;and
the house of Glaucon."</p>

<p>"But tell me, brother, how many talents has she
picked from your purse?"</p>

<p>Glaucon colored, but smiled, as he replied: "Well,
is not that, too, a princely habit?"</p>

<p>He quickly diverted the conversation from the uncomfortable
direction it was taking. The Princess
had humiliated him in his own eyes by outwitting
him in the Shattuck matter; and as a marred mirror
avenges itself by marring the reflection cast upon
it, so the image of Helena's virtue had now at
least one fault in Glaucon's judgment. She was over
sharp for him; an offense which at brief moments
fretted his love. But he was too proud to admit
that Deborah had touched a spot in him already
sensitive through irritation, and quickly resumed
the praise of the Princess.</p>

<p>"How divinely she speaks! and upon what
themes! Only courts have such instructors as she
has had. Alexander was not better taught by
Aristotle."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she sings and dances as well. Has she
exhibited these accomplishments also?" asked Deborah.</p>

<p>"How should I know of these things? My little
sister, educated as you have been in the narrowness
of our former Jewish life, you have not learned that
a free-born Greek woman, much more one of aristocratic
family, is never allowed to reveal to the other
sex such accomplishments as you mention, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
she possesses them. These arts of singing and dancing,
beautiful as they are, are left to the slave caste
for performance. Athena is not Terpsichore. But,
by the way, there are some fine artists of that sort
in Jerusalem. Several women noted for their beauty
of voice and limb came from Antioch with the
officers of Seron. They were nearly trodden to
death in the flight. They were found near Bethhoron,
and brought to the city, where we need
entertainment. Meton, the chief of the city garrison,
had them at the castle last night; and I can
get them here. Our Princess Helena and Lydia, with
Menelaos, will make a company before which they
will be proud to display their parts."</p>

<p>"Not here, Benjamin, in our father's house, not
here."</p>

<p>"Then in the house of Menelaos."</p>

<p>"Not there, I beg you; for Menelaos bears the
name of High Priest. Let us at least respect the
customs of Israel, if we no longer have its faith."</p>

<p>"Let it then be in the Princess' house. She has no
such silly scruples," replied Glaucon petulantly. "It
is the custom of the aristocracy of Greece to hire
their entertainers; poets to recite, orators to declaim,
pantomimists, dancers, players on instruments
and singers. Helena will arrange it all, if I
ask her."</p>

<p>"And if you pay for it?" suggested Deborah, as
Glaucon hurried away to carry out his new conceit.</p>

<p>Deborah watched the curtain through which he
had passed. Dark shadows were flung upon her face
from darker thoughts within. She paced the floor as
restively as a caged panther. The convulsive movement
of her fingers was as if they were clutching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and stifling some hideous insect which defiled them,
and which she would fling away when she had killed
it.</p>

<p>"How long is this to be?" she murmured. "But
that by my abiding here Jerusalem will be the
sooner rid of all this abomination, I would go to the
camp&mdash;or to the desert. But here I can best serve
Judas. Patience! Patience! But this impostor,
this Princess, forsooth! She must be unmasked."</p>

<h2>XXVII<br />

<span class="smaller">THE QUEEN OF THE GROVE</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> court around which the house of
Helena was built had, through liberal
draft upon the Princess' taste and Glaucon's
purse, been prepared for the entertainment.
The jet of water which
ordinarily rose in the centre of the court was turned
off, and the little marble basin in which the bronze
lotus leaves seemed to float was now covered over
with a platform extended and raised sufficiently to
display the performance.</p>

<p>Helena's nose turned too much upward for a Greek
ideal when, late in the day, she contemplated the
meagre decorations. Glaucon had hired a number of
men and boys to gather wild flowers from the fields;
but the dread of the ubiquitous Judas had kept these
gleaners within a few rods of the city gate. Lamps
enclosed in bags of various-colored linen and silk
were substituted for the lanterns of brass and silver
and opalescent stones which anciently had been the
common adornment of the houses of the well-to-do
people.</p>

<p>But whatever was lacking in these respects was
compensated by the brilliancy of the chamber which,
raised three steps above the pavement, opened upon
the court. This place was strewn with cushions
and skins of tiger and fox, so that the floor was
not unlike the body of a vast peacock lying with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
extended wings and tail. Amid these, and upon the
divans which ran round the three sides of the chamber,
reclined fair women; and hovering over them,
like humming-birds seeking the sweet of flowers,
stood high officers from the garrison, and a few of
the richest of the Greek priests in gala dress.</p>

<p>Menelaos asserted the prerogative of his rank, and
reclined with the fair sex. Glaucon, as chief patron
of the show, and more than patron of the hostess,
assumed a similar privilege.</p>

<p>"Is she not beautiful, my sister?" whispered the
Jew as Helena, having duly saluted her guests, with
a wave of the hand indicated the beginning of the
entertainment.</p>

<p>Helena evidently overheard the compliment, and
rewarded Glaucon with a smile that would have
captivated any voluptuary, though he were not already
infatuated, as was her present victim.</p>

<p>"She is very fair," replied Deborah.</p>

<p>"A palm-tree is not more stately among juniper
bushes than Helena among women," said the enamored
man.</p>

<p>"Rather say as graceful as a spotted serpent coiling
about a palm-tree," interjected his sister. "What
limbs for a dancer!"</p>

<p>Glaucon interpreted her comment to apply to another
woman, who at the moment seemed to have
materialized out of the tangled lamp rays, and appeared
upon the platform in the court. This airy
being stood long enough to assure the spectators
that she was of real flesh and blood. Then, with
hands outspread, she pivoted herself upon the slender
point of her foot, and gyrated with as little apparent
muscular effort as that of the wand which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a juggler twirls upon his finger. Two other women
joined her. Together they writhed in the set forms
of a dance, which was designed to show through
thin drapery the fine contour of their persons, the
proportion of their limbs, and grace of motion.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Menelaos, tossing a handful of
gold coins. As they rang upon the pavement, the
dancers, without stopping or marring their orderly
movements, picked up the gleaming spots.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" echoed Glaucon. "I have never seen it
better done. I remember the same figures executed
by the famous Thessalian sisters at Antioch. You
recall the dance, do you not?"</p>

<p>"I am not sufficiently versed in the art to recognize
the movements," replied the Priest.</p>

<p>"The wine will clear your wits," responded Glaucon,
nodding to the Princess for approval, which
was so sweetly given that it proved sufficient intoxicant
to the Jew without need of any from the
cup. He clapped his hands, signalling to the servants,
who filled the great goblet.</p>

<p>"This wine," said Glaucon, "I had sent from the
capital as a gift to our fair hostess. Let her first
spice it with a touch of her lips."</p>

<p>The Princess acknowledged the excellence of Glaucon's
choice by quaffing deeply, and then passed the
golden vessel to her guests.</p>

<p>The girls again appeared, one carrying a cythera,
another a tambour, the third castanets. The first
sang, to the accompaniment of her instrument, a
love song. Her voice had much natural sweetness,
and gave evidence of cultivation; but the notes soon
became husky and harsh, as if age-worn, although
the singer could scarcely have passed her first score<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of years. It gave proof of the dissipation which
soon ends the career of women of her class, unless
they are possessed of sufficient ambition and will
to practise a measure of present self-restraint for
the sake of longer future indulgence. The two other
girls joined in the chorus with tambour and castanets,
and afterwards executed a dance which was
pantomimic of the song.</p>

<p>Was it the gold that excited them, or is there a
spirit of the dance which resides somewhere in the
air or in the light, and enters the bodies of its votaries?
These women became ecstatic; they seemed to
emerge from themselves, and to become each a living
presence of Terpsichore. They closed their eyes
as if they danced in sleep. Their lips were parted
to inhale the intoxicating breath of their goddess,
who should thus supply the energy which physical
motion exhausted. The timing of their feet became as
pulse-beats, rhythmic, strong, flinging them through
the forms of the dance, as a fever throb whirls one
through the maze of fantastic visions. They bent
until their dishevelled hair touched the floor, like
stalks of grain beneath the weight of golden tassels.
Then, as the wind lifts the stalk and flings high its
bannered top, the women became erect. With instruments
above their heads, they swirled, each like a
glistening whirlpool, until the spectators were dizzied.</p>

<p>During the performance Helena had spiced the
wine more than once with her lips as she passed
the cup to Glaucon.</p>

<p>"The dance is shamefully poor," said she. "How
that girl mouthed her words, and failed to give the
right accent! The click of the castanets is not timed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to her motions. And the movement of her ankles&mdash;as
awkward as if her legs were flail-sticks. The girls
are not artists. Let them sing again, and I will
show them how."</p>

<p>She rose from the divan and, seizing the cythera
from the hand of one of the performers, rendered the
song with wonderful power. Now Helena's notes
floated as buoyantly as those of a lark, and anon
sank into exquisite softness and depth, as blue
wings sink into the azure. Then, dropping from her
shoulders her outer robe, with snapping fingers in
lieu of castanets, she gave the dance.</p>

<p>Helena's figure had evidently once been of that
perfect balance which makes the impression of being
without weight, and which, with the aid of proper
draperies, gives the illusion of floating in the air.
But her body had clearly taken on solidity, and a
distribution of substance better adapted to one who
would pose in stateliness than to one who would
play the sylph. There is a grace of motion and
another grace of inertia. Very young persons ordinarily
monopolize the former; the latter is the compensation
which nature gives for advancing years.
Helena did not realize the grade she had attained
in beautiful womanhood&mdash;not an uncommon inadvertence
of her sex. Otherwise she danced with
faultless art&mdash;art evidently acquired only through
careful instruction and lengthened practice; the art
which, according to Glaucon, was forbidden to
princely personages and free-born women among the
Greeks. Her performance ended in an attitude illustrative
of the closing lines of the song, in which the
singer accepts the embrace of her lover. Helena's
face flushed with the excitement of the exercise. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
eyes flickered unsteadily through the effect of the
wine. As the last note died upon her lips she reached
out her hands to Glaucon.</p>

<p>Whether the Jew was dazed by the superb acting,
or by the unexpected revelation on the part of the
actress, we may not say&mdash;but dazed he seemed, for
he sat stupidly still.</p>

<p>His irresponsive look startled, if it did not sober,
the dancer. She gazed about her; put her hand to
her head, as if to realize her identity; and, tripping
upon the robe which she had dropped from her
hand, fell into her seat.</p>

<p>"I must be ill," she said. "Give me&mdash;give me&mdash;some
wine."</p>

<p>One by one her guests, with such semblance of
courtesy as the Princess' condition allowed them to
render, took their departure; but not until one of
the dancing women was heard to declare:</p>

<p>"I will bet my garters that she is none other than
the great Clarissa herself; for I am sure that the
old Queen of the Grove of Daphne could not have
done it better. Did you catch the trill?"</p>

<p>"Aye, and the long step and the short one.
'Beauty's Limp' they call it. Clarissa invented that,
and all the girls in the Grove practised it; but they
say that nobody could do it perfectly except herself."</p>

<p>"I think that the Princess did it splendidly, except
that her flesh wobbled; she's too fat."</p>

<p>"What became of the Queen of the Grove?"</p>

<p>"I have heard that she went away with General
Apollonius. I will wager my silver anklets against
your bronze ones that Clarissa came down to Jerusalem
when Apollonius was killed, and that she has
been taken up by that fig-headed fellow who ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the drink. The Princess! Ha, ha! She's the Queen&mdash;our
Queen of Daphne! If she comes out again I
will fall down at her feet, and bite off a piece of her
big toe to carry back to Antioch as a memento;
that is, if we ever get out of this Jewish hole."</p>

<p>"May the gods favor us as well as they have
Clarissa!" was her companion's reply.</p>

<p>"Aye, when we get so heavy in the thighs, and so
stiff in the joints. When that comes I, too, will sell
what is left of me to a Jew. But let's have a
drink."</p>

<p>She threw a kiss at a Greek officer leaving the
court, and bent over the wine crater, singing:</p>

<h2>XXVIII<br />

<span class="smaller">A PRISONER</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-c.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Captain</span> Dion was not at the house of
Helena the night of the entertainment.
He was more seriously engaged with
Meton, the Commandant at the citadel.
The two men sat on opposite
sides of a narrow oaken table. This was the only
furniture of the stone-encased apartment, except the
low stools the men occupied, some changes of armor
that hung from the bronze pegs in the walls, a soldier's
chest, and a tankard and goblets which stood
between the Commandant and his guest. The men
were in striking contrast. Meton was short, broad-shouldered,
square-headed, crab-eyed, with complexion
which might have been due to weather exposure
or overmuch indulgence in wine&mdash;doubtless to both.</p>

<p>"I appreciate your feeling in regard to so fine a
woman," said the Commandant, "and I have no
doubt that she rewards your good offices with personal
favors. No offence, my friend, no offence! for
were I younger I should prize a woman's smile as
highly as you do. But I tell you, Captain, she must
be seized."</p>

<p>"With proper deference to your opinion," responded
Dion, "I am not prepared to admit the force of your
reasons for suspecting her. Indeed, I am quite sure
that I can disprove what her enemies say of her.
But, passing that, it were impolitic to lay hands on
one so close to Glaucon and the High Priest."</p>

<p>"Glaucon! He has not a shred of influence in Je<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>rusalem
except as Menelaos allows him to pose under
his shadow. And listen, Captain,"&mdash;lowering
his voice and glancing furtively about the apartment&mdash;"Menelaos
is through with Glaucon. The
Jew has about wound up his tether, and is of no
more use to the Priest than a date pit is to the
pulp after it has ripened. It is the High Priest himself
who has secured evidence against the woman.
I do not praise his purpose; but Menelaos, the circumcised
hypocrite, would be as false to us Greeks
as he has been to his own race, if his greed led that
way. Just now he is weighting his dice to get possession
of the estate of Elkiah, which they say
includes that of Ben Shattuck. If this Berenice, or
Deborah, or whatever her name may be, can be
proved to be in league with the Maccabæans, it
will be sufficient for the King, which is another
name for the High Priest, to confiscate the property;
since he would not trust Glaucon, who harbors her
in his house. It was different when she was thought
to be dead."</p>

<p>"But what evidence has been secured?" asked
Dion with simulated calmness, which one less stolid
than his companion would have seen to cover deep
excitement.</p>

<p>"Evidence? Evidence in abundance! Though I
confess to you, Captain, I don't believe a word of
it any more than you do. The woman is scarcely
more than a child, and yet the Princess is ready to
swear that she was once a Jewish spy whom she
herself had seen about the camp of Apollonius before
his blunder at the Wady. Faugh! It is incredible.
If fawns were used as hounds to scent out
leopards, then Glaucon's sister might be a spy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is the Princess' word all we have for the accusation?"</p>

<p>"No. We have caught two men who were with
Judas; they will swear for the sake of their lives&mdash;and
men will swear anything for that&mdash;that the
daughter of Elkiah was with the rebels just before
the battle of Bethhoron."</p>

<p>"But I could swear that she was not, for I myself
saw her in her brother's house the very night of
the battle," cried Dion, bringing his fist down upon
the table that separated them. "I will put my word
against the two traitors; and which will you take,
General Meton?"</p>

<p>"Quiet, Captain! quiet! or I will believe the report
that her black eyes have bewitched you. Whose
word will I take&mdash;yours or the Jews'? Why, theirs,
of course, since we will not allow you to testify at
all. Captain, you and I know that this is not an
affair of justice, but only a thread in some web the
High Priest and the Princess are spinning. But
what of that? Neither of us is big enough to withstand
Menelaos; and I, for one, will not attempt it.
The woman must be seized."</p>

<p>"But does the law of our service permit an accused
woman no defendant?"</p>

<p>"No defendant will be needed in this case. My
orders are peremptory. They come from General
Gorgias, that she shall be arrested, and held until
his arrival in the city, when he himself will judge the
case. But there is hope for her. She is marvellously
beautiful, though her eyes have too much
lightning in them for me. Gorgias is an artist in
flesh; and as the judges did in Phryne's case, he
will find as many witnesses of her innocence as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
she has charms. But, Captain, I can serve your
fancy. For your interest in the woman I will put
her custody into your hands until Gorgias comes.
You certainly will not object to that, or you have
colder blood than I credit your years with. You
may bring her to the citadel, or you may guard
her in her own house, in your arms if you want
to; but you know our laws&mdash;your life for hers if
she escapes. First, however, her accusation must be
published. On this the High Priest insists. Captain,
do you accept her custody, or shall I send another?"</p>

<p>"Under such circumstances, of course I accept,"
replied Dion, rising.</p>

<p>"Well," said Meton, laughing, "then I command
you, for I see you want to. Only don't fall in love
with her overmuch, or I shall be jealous of my appointment
and revoke it. One cup more with me,
Captain; and speak a good word for me with the
Princess; for when this pup of a Jew, Glaucon, is
out of the way, I may myself forget that I am not
young, and play the suitor."</p>

<p>Early the following morning a tall sarissa and
broad-brimmed hat sentinelled the house of Glaucon.
Another soldier was stationed just within the doorway,
while half a score lounged about the court,
under command of Captain Dion.</p>

<p>The news of Deborah's arrest produced excitement
and some consternation throughout the city; for
while Glaucon was hated, even as he was envied,
for his ill-gotten successes, nearly all the renegade
Jews in Jerusalem were conscious of serving the
King from the same greedy motives, and feared for
themselves now that the High Priest had turned
against one of his own kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who next?" was everywhere asked in whispers.</p>

<p>Captain Dion had his headquarters in the familiar
guest room of the house of Glaucon. He made
known to Deborah the accusation against her.</p>

<p>"Deborah, I am here to protect as well as guard
you," he protested. "You must escape. Let me go
with you, and if necessary die for you. What is one
soldier less to the armies of Antiochus? But a life
poured out in love's dear sake, ah! that would be
like a goblet of wine spilled upon an altar. Willingly
would I thus serve you, and I believe it would
be a sacrifice pleasing to your God."</p>

<p>Deborah was a long time silent. At length she
said:</p>

<p>"Dion, will you do anything, everything, for me?"</p>

<p>"Anything, everything," exclaimed the eager man.
"Speak the word, and I will go with you to the
camp of the Jews, or I will flee with you to the
tents beyond Jordan. Anything, everything," cried
he, abandoning himself to the sway of his passion.</p>

<p>"There is nothing I can ask that you will not do?
Are you sure? May I test you again?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing, nothing that I will not do
for you. I swear it. Test me. I long to prove
myself."</p>

<p>"Then, Dion, I command you to remain where you
are. Do your duty as a Greek soldier. Guard me if
you may. Lead me forth to execution if you must.
Let General Gorgias have his will with me. I will
not use your love to swerve you a hair's breadth
from your sworn duty to the service you are engaged
in."</p>

<p>"But, Deborah, how could I do this? You are
falsely accused. Never was there a more damnable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
lie. I myself can swear that you were not with the
Jews at the battle, for here I saw you."</p>

<p>Deborah turned away and paced the apartment;
then quickly turned:</p>

<p>"Dion, you are my custodian. More than that, I
make you my judge. You shall hear my confession.
I am not falsely accused. I am a Jewish spy. I
forbid that you swear to my innocence. Others may
speak untruth, but I will confess the facts before the
tribunal rather than your lips shall utter a word
that is false."</p>

<p>Dion heard with amazement, not so much at her
statement, for he had more than suspected its truth,
but at this new revelation of Deborah's spirit. He
exclaimed ardently:</p>

<p>"Then flee with me. Come! Come! This night
we may be far away, among your own people,
among the tribesmen beyond Moab; or we will go
to Egypt, or to Greece, or to Rome. My life is
yours, Deborah, whenever and for whatever you
may need me. Come! We can make safe flight."</p>

<p>"No, Dion. Though I may not say I love you, I
esteem you too much as my friend, as my father's
friend, to let you sacrifice your good name for me.
Be true to your duty here, until God Himself give
deliverance to His people."</p>

<p>"There is no deliverance for your people, Deborah,"
cried the Greek in despair. "The King's armies are
already gathering for another ascent from the plain
of Sharon. Within three weeks they will sweep all
this land as the tide of the Great Sea covers the
sands when the north wind blows."</p>

<p>"Then, why will not you go with your men?" exclaimed
Deborah, haughtily. "It is better to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
on the high field than to be left behind to guard a
girl. Honor and fame are there&mdash;here nothing for a
great soul; nothing for one who has been trained in
the court of Philip and in the army of Perseus of
Macedon."</p>

<p>Her attitude and voice were so dramatic that they
might have turned even Glaucon into a hero.</p>

<p>Then her tones became taunting: "Has Dion, son
of General Agathocles, no ambition? Are you like a
new-born ant that has wings on its back, but suffers
them to be torn off by its sisters? Oh, Dion, if I
were a man, think you I would be content to play
the cat at a mouse-hole, as you are doing here,
when the hosts are marching? Go! Let Meton
send his citadel cooks. They will be sufficient to
watch me here. But not you, Dion! Give up your
custody, I beg you."</p>

<p>Dion caught her martial spirit, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah, if you were a man, Deborah, I would love
you as your ancient Prince Jonathan did the heroic
David. Side by side we would fight even for the
Jews' cause. I swear it! But," he dropped his
voice, and, weighing every word with sincerity and
decision, added, "Deborah, I shall remain here with
you, unless you will go with me."</p>

<p>Deborah's manner instantly changed. Her soldierly
enthusiasm became the transport of a prophetess.</p>

<p>"Dion, believe me, the host of Gorgias will never
make the ascent to Jerusalem. I know it. The
sword of our God is in the hand of Judas. The
child Caleb sat yesterday looking toward the west,
his eyes expanded more largely than ever. 'What
do you see?' I asked; for in such moods I have
found him to be gifted with a seer's sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I see,' said he, 'the armies of the Gentiles. They
swarm like bees toward the towers of Jerusalem.
Now they are at Emmaus. But the sword of the
Lord and of Judas gleams through the air. It
severs the flying host. See! see! The bees have lost
their guidance. They scatter everywhere. They dissolve
like smoke in the air!' I know not where the
child gets such visions, but more oft than otherwise
they come true."</p>

<p>Dion shook his head.</p>

<p>"Deborah, if your God shall again work miracles
this dream may become true; but if Judas were in
league with Egypt or Rome he could not stop the
advance of Gorgias. Any one of the three Greek
armies can destroy the Maccabæans, while the
others sweep the land, as freely as the breezes blow,
from Samaria to the South Desert. I thank God
that neither you nor I shall be in the coming battle.
Why, Deborah, should I fight? How can I care
whether Antiochus widen his empire, and rob more
lands to spend his revenues on new favorites, such
as those about us here? But I could fight for a
cause, for something I esteemed holy, as I do yours.
I believe that you could touch me and transform me
into&mdash;into a Jew. One thing I vow: If Judas escape
the oncoming armies I will believe in Caleb's
vision. I will offer your great champion my sword
at the gate of Jerusalem, and confess that he is the
long-promised Deliverer whom all people as well
as yours believe will some day come to restore right
boundaries and exalt good men. This I swear, and
make your sweet lips witness. Let them call me
traitor if I keep not this vow."</p>

<p>"Did then," replied Deborah, "our blind seer dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
again correctly? He said that he saw Dion wearing
a Jew's shirt beneath his Greek toga. But,
Dion, do not follow such impulses. Your career is
that of a soldier. In that occupation you may acquire
renown, riches, power; for I myself once heard
one of your generals say that there was more genius
for command in Dion's head than in the whole war
councils of the King. Only be as just as you are
brave&mdash;such men are needed everywhere. But alas!
too well I know that, unless God helps, one will
find only poverty and suffering and death among
the Jews. Our reward is not here, but in that unknown
land where we believe our fathers who have
fallen asleep wake and walk. Without that sure
faith, Dion, you must not become a Jew. But we
must part. Call me when the swordsman or jailer
is ready&mdash;and I will forgive you."</p>

<p>She retired into her apartment.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Between</span> the conflict of his own thoughts
and Glaucon's outbursts of rage at the
indignity cast upon his house, the day
passed drearily for Captain Dion. But
the night brought new excitement.</p>

<p>The narrowness of the streets made them dark
almost as soon as the glints of the setting sun had
climbed above the parapets and vanished into the
upper air. No lamps were now burning, as in peaceful
times, at the doorways of the houses. Upon the
city walls and at the great gates loomed the outlines
of the sentinels, the click of whose sarissas,
brought to the ground at each turn on their beats,
alone broke the stillness. The streets were deserted,
except as here and there a light blinked through
the opening door of some low resort, out of which
revellers stumbled into the night; or as some thief,
with bare and noiseless feet, evaded a house guard
who was sleeping before the gate of an official or
protected inhabitant.</p>

<p>It was about the sixth hour when three shadows,
like so many condensations of the night itself, moved
up the Street of David from the direction of the
Temple. In a moment as many more followed. Others
came stealthily out of the alleys, and appeared
suddenly in the main street, as if they were exhalations
from the pools of water between the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
stones of the pavement. If one had owl's eyes one
might have detected more of these moving patches of
darkness, some taking covert behind the projecting
lattice-work of the bazaar windows, or within the
screening lintels of the doorways. At first they
seemed like common night waifs seeking places to
sleep; but as sticks in a whirlpool make each its
own gyrations, then float out through a common
channel, so all these men drifted toward the house
of Glaucon.</p>

<p>The sentinel stationed there observed one such
shadow near him, and challenged it. While engaged
in attempting to unravel what he thought were
the comer's drunken accents into intelligible words,
a grip from behind was upon his throat, and before
he could utter an outcry a short sword had
entered his body.</p>

<p>A rap on the door brought the challenge, to which
the Greek watch-word "Avenge Bethhoron" was
given. The cross-bar had scarcely lifted when in
poured a score of men. The door-keeper fell, and in a
few moments all the Greek guard were silent in their
blood, except Captain Dion who, standing at vantage
upon the platform of the room leading from the
court, by splendid sword-play held off his assailants.
The leader of the attacking party, after watching
for a moment the uneven fight, laid his sword across
the swords of the men.</p>

<p>"Back, men! I will deal with this fellow."</p>

<p>The speaker was a short but powerfully built
man. His head was protected by a helmet of thick
leather, which was in keeping with the black, coarse,
chain-knit, iron corsage that covered his upper person.
His form was as compact and as lithe as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of a leopard, and his pose that of equal alertness.
Without for an instant letting his sword drop from
its position for thrust, and holding Dion at guard
as the weapon seemed to search his body for a vulnerable
point, the man spoke:</p>

<p>"You are in command here?"</p>

<p>"When I had any one to command," replied Dion,
glancing at the dead bodies lying about the court.
"But who are you?"</p>

<p>"No matter who," replied the invader; "I demand
the person of the daughter of Elkiah."</p>

<p>"My life is forfeit for her," replied Dion. "Come
on."</p>

<p>His challenge was not accepted by his antagonist,
who, holding his weapon in guard, asked, "Your
name, gallant Greek?"</p>

<p>"Captain Dion, at your service, sir. Come on."</p>

<p>The man lowered his sword.</p>

<p>"Retire, men. Captain Dion, a word with
you."</p>

<p>"Tell me first by whose authority you have entered
here," asked Dion.</p>

<p>"By the authority of the God of Israel, and Judas,
son of Mattathias, we came. And now, as you can
see, since your comrades are dead, we remain here
by authority of our own swords. Twenty to one
is scarcely fair play, and we have that vantage of
you. Yield!"</p>

<p>Captain Dion was not more persuaded by the
fighting odds against him than he was led by certain
other considerations to give up the fight. He
at once replied:</p>

<p>"I yield upon one condition&mdash;that no harm shall
come to the lady Deborah."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our purposes seem to be one," replied the stranger.
"Is the name of Jonathan, brother of Judas,
sufficient guarantee for her safety?"</p>

<p>"Jonathan!" ejaculated Dion. "And yet your entrance
in spite of our guards might have made me
suspect one surnamed 'The Wily.' Have you Maccabæans
taken the city?"</p>

<p>"It is enough that we have taken this house, and
that you are our prisoner. Will you deliver the
woman to us, or shall we take her out over your
body? The choice is yours."</p>

<p>"I am a Greek soldier," said Dion. "My life will
be forfeit by our own rules if I yield. My honor
will at least be sustained if I fall guarding my
charge."</p>

<p>He struck the attitude of defense.</p>

<p>"I had rather fall beneath the hands of twenty
foemen, than be led out to die like a dog by my own
people. Come on! You have my answer."</p>

<p>Jonathan did not move.</p>

<p>"Guard yourself, then!" said Dion, advancing.
Jonathan made no sign of self-defense.</p>

<p>Dion lowered his sword. "I cannot kill a man
who will not fight."</p>

<p>"Plainly not. You are not a soldier of that sort,
and thus are unlike your fellow Greeks," said the
Maccabæan.</p>

<p>"Do not taunt me," was the reply. "I believe that
the daughter of Elkiah will be safer with Jonathan
than with myself. For her sake I yield."</p>

<p>He presented his weapon.</p>

<p>"Not so, Captain Dion," replied the Jew. "Keep
your sword. You may need it to defend yourself
from others. Now lead me to the lady Deborah. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
respect her too highly to invade her privacy without
heralding by her appointed guardian. Use
your sword on me, Captain Dion, if I force her
to do aught against her will. We two will go
alone."</p>

<p>Jonathan bade his men retire.</p>

<p>The frightened servants had hidden away at the
first noise of the encounter; but as the two men
approached Deborah's apartment their way was
blocked by old Huldah, who stood with arms
akimbo, and behind her Ephraim.</p>

<p>"The lady Deborah is ill, and no one can see her,"
cried Huldah, as valiantly as if Ephraim were a
whole battalion supporting her.</p>

<p>"Here is a military exigency which I fear the
tactics of neither Greek nor Jew is equal to,"
laughed Jonathan. "We should have brought up
our battering rams."</p>

<p>It is difficult to surmise what would have been the
issue of this impending collision between a noted
warrior and the puissant Huldah, had not little
Caleb appeared at the instant the battle was about
to be joined. Recognizing the voice of his friend of
the Rocks, he ran to him with a delighted cry:</p>

<p>"Jonathan! Jonathan!"</p>

<p>"My child!" cried the Maccabæan with equal
eagerness, as he caught the lad to his arms. "And
Deborah, where is she?"</p>

<p>"Why, Deborah is gone two hours since," exclaimed
the child. "She is now far away as Mizpah,
or maybe Bethel. But, Jonathan, have we taken
the city yet? And was Gorgias killed as I saw in
my dream?"</p>

<p>"The Lord grant that your dream may be as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of Gideon's soldiers the night before the destruction
of the Philistines, when a barley cake overturned a
tent," said Jonathan, kissing the blind eyes. "Deborah
is gone? Where then, Captain Dion, is your
boasted protection of this woman, whom you say
you were ordered to guard? If she could go and
come without your permission, why might not
others have captured her? It is well that I, a Jew,
have been ordered to relieve guard here to-night,
since you, a Greek, have not kept it."</p>

<p>"Your words are deserved," replied Dion, bewildered
by Caleb's news. "I cannot account for it.
Deborah has not passed out by the court gateway
into the street, that I can swear. Nor do I think
she has flown through the air."</p>

<p>"For aught you know, Sir Greek, she may have
done so. Remember that you are in the Jews' land.
Here you must be prepared to believe such things as
were never dreamed of by your people. This is, as
you have doubtless heard, a land of miracles. Every
hill and cave has a story, as true as that Deborah
has outwitted your senses. But pardon my mirth,
Captain. I see that your head sits lightly on your
shoulders for having let your bird break cage, and I
suggest that, if you do not care to submit your
neck to the whim of your superior officer, you go
with us. I doubt not we can put you again in
charge of your fair captive, or at least where you
will risk nothing if you avow that she escaped with
your connivance. I think, Captain, that you will
have to go with us. Come."</p>

<p>Captain Dion put forth his hands.</p>

<p>"You may bind me."</p>

<p>"You are too brave a man for that," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Jonathan. "The name of Dion is not unknown to
us. You may bind yourself with your word. It
will suffice. Besides, you will need both hands in
scrambling out of this town, and maybe your sword,
for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Jonathan's</span> sentence was not completed.
There was a sudden sound of
the quick-timed, regular tramp of
many feet in the street. Meton, hearing
of the commotion in the house of
Glaucon, had sent thither a detachment from the
citadel. There were a few sharp words of command
outside, followed by the crashing in of the gate.
Then came a moment's silence. This was while the
Greek rescuers were forming for a dash through the
portal; for they knew that the foremost would fall
beneath the unseen swords that were ready to meet
them.</p>

<p>Jonathan and his men were already in the breach.
Man after man dropped in his tracks as the Greeks
crossed the threshold. The assailants, though baffled,
kept the gate open by thrusting back of the
hinges a piece of timber which they had used as a
sort of battering ram. The passage was soon
choked with a pile of dead bodies. The Greeks then
massed a number of spearmen who, with their bristling
points thrust far ahead of them, essayed to
rush their antagonists. This ruse was unfortunate;
for no sooner were the spear-heads beyond the lintels
than they were grasped by strong hands, and
thrown upward, thus leaving the unprotected bodies
of those who had used them at the mercy of the
Jews' swords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The Greeks had surely lost the fight had not
Meton ordered another party of his men to enter the
adjacent houses, climb to the roofs, and from them
reach that of the house of Glaucon. Having gained
this advantage, they poured down in a torrent of
destruction. The Greek servants were spared. Huldah
and Ephraim in some mysterious manner disappeared.
Glaucon, or what was left of the living
man, since his fright had been well-nigh as fatal to
him as a stone from a catapult would have been,
was dragged from beneath a divan, but only to be
shoved back again as into a place of security, while
a soldier was set to prod him if he should attempt
to come out.</p>

<p>An officer finding Dion, laid his hand upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Captain, I must put you under arrest. You will
harbor me no ill will if I obey my orders?"</p>

<p>"Do your duty, Mercedes, or I myself will report
you," replied Dion.</p>

<p>The Captain extended his hands, which were
quickly bound with his own belt.</p>

<p>The uneven fight was soon over in the court. A
score of Jews were either slain or captured, though
more than twice that number of their antagonists
measured their lengths upon the pavement. One lay
with his head in the fountain basin at the feet of
Aphrodite, and stared with his dead eyes into the
face of the marble beauty that gazed down into
them.</p>

<p>"Who is the leader of this gang of rebels?" asked
Meton.</p>

<p>"The Lord of Hosts is our leader!" said one of the
captives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"The lord of the host?" queried Meton. "Has
then the great Judas fallen into my trap? Shade of
Apollonius! this is lucky for me. But where is your
lord of the host?"</p>

<p>He turned over the bodies of the dead Jews to
look at their faces. "He is not here&mdash;nor here.
None of these have stature enough for the giant."</p>

<p>Jonathan, anxious for the fate of Caleb, had gone
seeking for him in the upper part of the house. His
way was blocked by an immense Greek who strode
across a chamber carrying the blind boy beneath his
arm. No sooner had Jonathan spied him than the
man's dead hands dropped his burden. But a crowd
of soldiers had followed the daring Jew, and now
seemed to have him as their captive. Thrusting
Caleb behind him, Jonathan kept his assailants at
bay by the lightning movement of his blade.</p>

<p>"This way, Jonathan! this way!" cried the lad;
and, so guided, Jonathan retreated step by step,
now between the opening curtains; now across another
chamber; then down a flight of stone steps.
At length he was in darkness.</p>

<p>"This way, Jonathan!" sounded the thin voice of
the child from the cellar.</p>

<p>The Greeks who came after stopped, being unable
to see any object; but thrust with their swords
through the darkness.</p>

<p>"Hold off, men, we have him trapped!" shouted
one of the leaders. "Ten men guard this stairway.
The rest of you go with me to the cellarway
in the court. We will pick him out with our spear-points,
or burn him out like a fox in a hole; it
matters not which way the rascal wants to die. It
is the great Judas himself in spite of his size, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
there is only one man who can handle the sword as
this fellow does. But for all that I would have had
the better of him just now were it not that that
blind brat can see in the dark. Indeed, I stuck him
once like a pig at the bottom of the steps."</p>

<p>"You lie," said another. "You stuck me; and
but for my hand catching your blade you would
have hamstrung me with your jab&mdash;jab&mdash;jab at
everything and nothing. I tell you I had the Jew by
the throat, and would have throttled him but for you."</p>

<p>"Had him by the throat?" shouted another. "You
had me by the throat. I was in front of you. I
shall claim the reward when we get him. I swear
it was I that drove him down these steps. I had
knocked up his sword, and was closing on him
when you put your camel's foot of a fist on my
throat."</p>

<p>While some watched by the cellarways, and the
leaders consulted upon means to extricate their
valiant prey without danger to themselves, Jonathan
was being piloted safely by Caleb through the
subterranean passage. For a while he followed the
lad. They at length came to a place where the path
became two. Here Jonathan took the child into his
arms.</p>

<p>"From this point I know the way," said he.
"When we came in by the crevice in the wall that
Meph told us of, we went up that passage until we
came out in the Temple court. And there, Caleb,
we swore before the broken altar of our Lord to
give our lives if need be for your and Deborah's
rescue."</p>

<p>"But how did you know of our danger?" queried
the lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Old Ephraim told Meph of her being under arrest
in her house, and Meph brought us word at Mizpah.
But here is our change of uniform. Let me get out
of these vile Greek trappings before they give me
some plague. Alas, that our brave men could not
come back with us! But we will avenge them yet,
the Lord willing."</p>

<p>"Will not Greek clothes serve you better when we
come into the fields?" asked Caleb.</p>

<p>"No Greek dares to walk a furlong beyond the
walls in the night time," replied Jonathan. "The
whole country belongs to the jackals, the foxes, to
us, and to God."</p>

<p>"Can you see God's eyes, Jonathan?" asked Caleb
as they emerged from the crevice.</p>

<p>"No, not now; the stars are not out to-night;
but I can see God's smile, for the day is breaking
over Moab. You are tired, little brother. My
shoulder must be as hard a saddle as a camel's
hump."</p>

<p>Jonathan took the blind child into his arms, and
Caleb, with his hands about the soldier's neck, and
face hidden in his thick beard, after awhile fell asleep.
The child's weight did not weary the strong man,
but his spirit, so gentle, so pure, so wise, seemed to
Jonathan to mingle with his own, as the water
purling from some mountain spring, cool and clean
and sweet, mingles with a muddied stream. There
were tears on the face of the man of battle, when,
just as the day dawned, he laid his sleeping burden
down in a nook between the rocks.</p>

<p>A Jewish soldier went by; his iron helmet was
slung back. Touching his bared head, he gave the
sentinel's watchword, "As the Lord liveth," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
passed on. And such as he were walking in every
by-path and ravine and on every hill-top from Jerusalem
to Samaria, watching over the land as faithfully
as the stars keep their nightly beats in the
heavens. Jonathan bent over the sleeping child,
and kissed the little hand that lay against the moss.
Then, signalling to another sentry, he pointed to the
spot and walked away.</p>

<p>In an hour he returned.</p>

<p>When Jonathan and Caleb reached the camp at
Mizpah, they were alarmed to learn that Deborah
was not there, nor had she been seen by any one.</p>

<p>Many possible explanations of her absence were
suggested, which varied chiefly according to the degree
in which anxiety sank toward despair. Most
believed that she had failed to pass safely through
the cordon of guards, and had been captured by the
Greeks.</p>

<p>Others inclined to the opinion that she had fallen
into the hands of marauding tribesmen, whose fleet
steeds were often seen between the city and the Maccabæan
camps. Sometimes a horseman and tall
lance would be silhouetted against the sky from
distant rising ground, then disappear as quickly as
the horned wild goats of the Lebanons at the slightest
movement to stalk them. Scouts reported that
similar shapes moved like shadows along the hillsides,
pausing only in spots where the color of the
rock or of tree clumps toned with that of the horse,
as by a similar ruse certain birds and lizards escape
the observation of their sharpest-eyed enemies.</p>

<p>These apparitions gave credit to rumors that the
sheikhs of various tribes were preparing to side with
the Greeks. These rumors were at first without in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>telligible
basis, for nothing had as yet occurred to
clearly prove any breach of neighborly relations between
the peasants of Judea and the herdsmen of
the Jordan and eastward. It was as when a coming
storm heralds itself to the instincts of birds and
cattle, and sets the tree-toads croaking before any
shred of a cloud appears in the sky.</p>

<p>Judas sent his scouts eastward. They reported
the fleecy indications of unsettled political weather
in the multitude of tents which were gathered in
hitherto unoccupied positions in the valley of the
Jordan and the mountainous regions beyond. The
tribesmen were massing. For this there could be
but one purpose&mdash;to strike Judas' rear. This discovery,
which discouraged others, stimulated the
champion to keener thought and buoyancy. He had
the joy of a sailor at the prospect of high seas.</p>

<p>Yet Judas had his times of moodiness. Jonathan
had often remarked to Simon that these spells were
never produced by danger, but either by something
in Judas' physical condition, or some mysterious sentiment
that made him its victim. The report that
Deborah had left the city, or something which timed
itself with that announcement, now plunged him
into the depths. He brooded stolidly. His alertness
of faculty took on a seeming lethargy. His
brethren tried to rouse him by the news of the
movements of the new Greek armies under Gorgias
and Nicanor and Lycias, who were reported to have
passed down the valley of the Litany, that portal
of Syria between the Lebanon ranges through which
the invaders of Israel had so often come.</p>

<p>"We must put our men in motion," urged Jonathan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye," was Judas' laconic response.</p>

<p>"But when shall we move?" was eagerly asked.</p>

<p>"When the time comes."</p>

<p>"But when will the time come?"</p>

<p>"When I say so." And Judas turned away.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Deborah's</span> flight from the city had not
been for her own personal safety, else
she would have taken Caleb with her.
When she emerged from the crevice, instead
of going northward toward the
fastnesses of the Maccabæans, she turned to the
east, at first keeping close to the city wall. The
night was dark except for the occasional flashes of
lightning, the couriers of a coming storm. In the
momentary glare she took in the stations of the few
Greek sentinels who patrolled the immediate fields.
They were looking for no danger from the direction
of the walls, but peered outward, questioning
with spear-point every shadow which the sudden
flashes projected beyond the rocks and bushes.</p>

<p>It was thus not difficult for Deborah to reach
without detection the extreme northeastern angle
of the city. She here sat down to watch for opportunity
to pass unobserved into the open ground beyond.
She thought of the old walls at her back,
worn by the storms of centuries, and broken by the
war-shocks of many generations; the armored forms
close to her, each one like the claw of the monster
power of Syria which was crushing, tearing, devouring
the nation; the great black sky overhead, like
some flying dragon, so vast as to cover and smother
the land. How little was she! Only a single fibre
in the writhing flesh of the victim! Her life was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
insignificant! Doubtless before many days she would
lay it down, if she remained in the city; perhaps
sooner on this adventure.</p>

<p>Her fingers felt between them a tiny berry. "I
am less than this," she thought, "for it may abide
when I am gone. Yet if I press this seed down into
the dirt, it will breed life in its decay. May I not
yield something if I fall? What now if I can bring
to Judas a hundred men! That will be worth dying
for! He would not allow me to make this venture
if he knew it. That is well; then that brave heart
cannot bear the blame if it miscarry. So I give my
life to God and His cause."</p>

<p>She pressed the berry into the ground, and
smoothed the dirt above it with her hand.</p>

<p>The lightning split the heavens with terrific shock.
A tower above the eastern gate caught the bolt
as a shield would ward a flaming dart. The rain
came down in torrents. The sentinels retired closer
to the walls, drawing nearer together as their line
shortened. In a moment Deborah would be discovered!
But while their eyes were dazed by another
crash she pushed boldly between them and ran.</p>

<p>"What was that?" said a soldier. "I must have
stepped upon a jackal."</p>

<p>"It was as big and black as a wolf," was his
comrade's reply. "They say the dead Jews' ghosts
come back to the city in wolf shapes."</p>

<p>"I heard one the other night. He seemed, from
the noise he made, to be walking on two legs with
a crutch; but when I came to him he darted in
among the bushes, and back to Hades; for there
wasn't a sign of him above ground."</p>

<p>Deborah sped down the long slope from the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
wall to the Kedron, and across it, and up the side
of Olivet. She did not see her way, yet kept it, following
every turn of the footpath; for she dared
not venture upon the high-road, knowing this to
be sentinelled. When she heard any sound on the
beaten track she crossed the fields, over ditches,
around boulders, past garden walls of dried clay.
She did not stumble, though she gave no heed to
where she stepped. Were her senses and muscles
preterhumanly alert, as those of a swallow skimming
the ground and striking nothing? Did instinct
assert itself over the slower-paced judgment,
as in the case of frightened deer and homing pigeons?
Did the angels bear her up in their hands
according to the promise? She asked not, nor did
she even wonder. The inner light of her purpose
was so strong that her soul dominated all physical
limitation&mdash;for a while. At length on Olivet,
midway the ascent, she fell utterly exhausted. Then
she first realized the weakness of the flesh, and
rebelled against it. How long it took to steady
the panting breath! and for the heart to stop its
violent beating!</p>

<p>After a few moments' rest she rose. Her feet were
stones in weight. Would that they had been as
hard! for a sharp pain drew her attention to the
fact that one foot had broken its sandal, and was
bruised and bleeding. She could not run; she
trudged on.</p>

<p>She came out upon the broad road, and passed
through Bethany. No one accosted her, for the
once happy village was now deserted. Even the
dogs had followed the people when they fled from
the invaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The day broke. The road grew white with its
dust, then ruddy with the coming light. Her faintness
told her that she hungered, and she remembered
that she had made provision for this. She
drew from her bosom a handful of bread and dates,
and ate. At a spring, where once had stood a khan,
she drank amid a circle of bewildered sheep, which
bleated and stared at this intruder of what for
many months had been their solitude.</p>

<p>She must rest; yet what if she should be too late?
Already the tribesmen about Jericho might have begun
to fulfil their threat, and move against Judas.
These men had been the enemies of her people for
ages. Not since Joshua crossed their plain had they
been at peace, except at times when the degenerate
Jews mingled their blood in marriage with that of
these heathen. Toward the Chasidim, those extremists
who would purge the land of all but the
pure stock of Israel, these tribes had sworn special
hatred. Now that the Maccabæans were facing new
armies of Syria, the rumor of the fields became the
open boast in Jerusalem, that the whole population
of the Jordan valley was about to assail Judas'
rear; for Antiochus' gold had corrupted every
Sheikh from the Sea of Galilee to the Sea of Salt.</p>

<p>And who was she, a girl, to turn these fierce
fighters from their remorseless purpose? A straw to
change the course of the Jordan! A child's hand to
divert from its path an avalanche on the slope of
Hermon. Yet a child's hand can give direction to
an avalanche, by breaking the frozen front in this
or yonder ravine. Doubtless the child would be
swept away by the descending mass; but what
mattered that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Though her limbs scarcely obeyed her will to rise,
Deborah could not rest. She might be too late.
This fear suddenly became almost a terrible conviction.
There were clattering hoof-beats on the
hard roadway. She concealed herself behind the
ruined wall of the khan. Two horsemen rode slowly
up, pausing upon an adjacent knoll, and inspecting
the country far and wide. Their horses were almost
hidden beneath their housings of network and
tassels. This, however, did not conceal the long
and slender limbs and narrow flanks of the beasts,
their broad, deep breasts and thick necks, which
showed that they were of that thorough breed for the
rearing of which the Arabs had already become famous.</p>

<p>The two riders were swarthy, almost black. One
was young, his sparse beard fringing and breaking
the perfect oval of his face. The other was old,
unless the deep lines across his brow, like the valleys
and gorges about him, had been made by sudden
convulsions, the sharp crises of his life. The
youth's eyes were like the fountain beside which
they stopped&mdash;sparkling, yet calm and fully exposed.
The old man's eyes were like the pools which one,
standing on the cliffs, sees gleaming far down in
the deep gorge of the Kedron, as that stream cuts
its way through the mountains of rocks which
would bar its progress to the Sea of Salt.</p>

<p>In dismounting the elder man seemed the younger,
so quick was his motion in taking the long lance
from its rest, and planting it in the ground as the
tether post for his steed.</p>

<p>"Neither Jews nor Greeks are concerning themselves
with us to-day. That is clear, father," said
the younger man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is true, then," said the veteran, "that they are
both looking for a battle to the west. Judas' men
were only yesterday scouring this part of the country,
but they are now withdrawn. That means
that the Maccabæan expects another fight with the
Greeks speedily, for Judas never calls in his men
until he wants them to strike. They are like the
fingers on his hand; they turn into a fist only for
the blow. We will ride back, Nadan, and advise the
camps to move against the Maccabæan to-morrow."</p>

<p>Deborah heard this with consternation. The man
was surely Sheikh Yusef, the Arab, the fiercest of the
tribesmen of the valley. She must act instantly.</p>

<p>A slight groan attracted the attention of the men.
Turning the corner of the ruined wall they detected
her crouching form.</p>

<p>"Who is here? By my beard, a woman!"</p>

<p>Deborah rose, and with clasped hands, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Your pity! Do not harm me!"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said Yusef. "And what brought
you to such a place?"</p>

<p>"I am fleeing from Jerusalem. I am the daughter
of Elkiah."</p>

<p>"Elkiah's daughter a fugitive, and in such a
plight? Has your brother turned you out? We had
heard that he was in high feather with his new
friends."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Deborah, "my brother is himself endangered.
All are in danger there. Have you not
heard?"</p>

<p>"We have heard nothing. Tell us."</p>

<p>"Not heard!" said Deborah, in feigned surprise.
"The Romans, the strong people from the west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
from over the Great Sea, from beyond Cyprus, beyond
Greece, are coming. It is reported that their
fleets are seen from the shore; that they have overcome
the Syrian ships; that they have made alliance
with Egypt; that vast armies, the armies that
destroyed Perseus, are about to march through the
desert, and come upon Syria by way of the valley.
The Greeks in Jerusalem distrust the Jews who have
submitted. They believe that my people have played
them false, and will turn to the Romans. Meton is
slaughtering us."</p>

<p>The two Arabs looked at each other with faces
that showed perplexity. They withdrew to a little
distance. Deborah could not catch all their words,
but enough to know that her ruse was not altogether
futile. However well bribed with Greek gold,
the tribesmen would not risk the alliance of Antiochus
if this new power of Rome were to come upon
the scene. The Republic of the West was regarded as
invincible along the Great Sea, but had not yet
essayed to strike Asia. If the crash of empires were
to take place it were wise for the nomadic peoples
to throw themselves with neither Greek nor Roman
until there were some signs as to which power
would prove the stronger.</p>

<p>The older man remounted.</p>

<p>"But, father, we cannot leave the daughter of
Elkiah here," said the younger. "She must go with
us."</p>

<p>Deborah had risen to her feet. The hood dropped
from her head. Was it her grateful look, or only her
surpassing beauty, that held the young Arab?</p>

<p>"You will go with us? You can ride?" said he.</p>

<p>"Nay, I must go to my kinsman, Ben Aaron of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Masada. To seek refuge there I have fled. Tell me
the shortest way, I beg of you."</p>

<p>"To Masada? That is a long journey, and rough,
and full of dangers. You cannot go there alone."</p>

<p>Nadan held rapid speech with old Yusef, the conclusion
of which was this, on his part:</p>

<p>"It is true we must not leave her here, nor can
we delay. Take you the woman, Nadan. Cross
the gorge of Kedron. By the night you can be at
Masada, and by the morning back with us. Nadan,
the woman is comely. Were I not needed with the
people, she should share my saddle, not yours. No
loitering, my son. My salutation to Ben Aaron, the
damned Jew!&mdash;but it is unwise to damn him in the
present emergency. His castle on Masada will be
the strongest in the wilderness&mdash;when we get it.
Speak him fair, and let the gift of his kinswoman be
a pledge of peace between us&mdash;until we see fit to
break it. That woman's breath on your cheek
ought to give you soft words for Ben Aaron."</p>

<p>He placed his long lance in its resting strap,
bowed his head to the neck of his steed&mdash;both a
salaam to the woman and a signal of haste to the
beast&mdash;and disappeared over the hill like an autumn
leaf whirled away by the wind.</p>

<h2>XXXII<br />

<span class="smaller">THE CASTLE OF MASADA</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-n.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Nadan</span> would have been no true son of
Yusef if the commission to escort the
fair Jewess had not been a pleasing
one; for the old Sheikh was known
as the "Solomon of the Tents," and
many a Shulamite maiden had looked upon him as
"black but comely."</p>

<p>The paternal badinage with his son about the
girl's breath upon his cheek was undoubtedly as
unwise as it was unnecessary. But Deborah herself
saved the young man from all temptation.</p>

<p>When Nadan returned to her she was standing
with face uplifted, as when one is looking at some
far-distant object in the lower sky. Her eyes did
not rest on the summit of Nebo or Pisgah, whose
grayish-blue peaks rose like gigantic towers on the
agate wall of the mountains of Moab. Beyond
them, beyond all the earth, her soul seemed to be
drinking from fountains in the sky.</p>

<p>Nadan's approach did not at once divert her rapt
attention. The youth felt something like resentment
at her indifference to his presence. Did not the
maidens of the valley sing and dream the praise of
Nadan? And if his comeliness had been less, was he
not the richest of the young lords of the tribes, and
their most daring rider?</p>

<p>Just now, as he stood beside his splendid steed,
one hand upon the lustrous mane, the other grasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>ing
the tall spear to draw it from its socket in the
ground, his attitude was such as to fascinate any
lover of a manly form. He was fully conscious of
this, and kept his pose at first in the hope that the
woman would notice him. Then he remained motionless
because the spell which held Deborah looking
heavenward also held him staring at her. His
feeling of slighted dignity passed away almost as
quickly as the shadow of a flying bird. Deborah
seemed more than a woman, some priestess illumined
with the light of her shrine, which was invisible to
all eyes but her own. The Arab felt himself drawn
to a kindred worship; at least, he worshipped the
worshipper.</p>

<p>Slowly the rhapsody faded from her face. When
she turned toward her companion she was simply a
woman, with a girlish sweetness and timidity.
Nadan had seen a flower which, when the sunlight
fell upon it, burst at once from bud to glorious
fulness, and when darkness came closed its petals
again. Were human beings sometimes gifted with
such powers? All his Arab superstitions about
genii and other wonderful creatures who live on the
borderland between the visible and invisible world
were beginning to perplex and awe him, when Deborah's
simple and confiding manner reassured him
that he had only a human being to deal with,
though an exceedingly fascinating one.</p>

<p>"I shall conduct you to Masada," said he, making
deep obeisance.</p>

<p>"It need not be," replied Deborah.</p>

<p>"It must be," said the youth, with a tone of
authority which, however, indicated that he was
commanding himself rather than her. "The way is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
full of dangers. Few ever cross the great gorge of
the lower Kedron; and none but those who know
the path. All the wild beasts, driven from the open,
find lair in its caves and thickets."</p>

<p>"Then I will follow the highway to Jericho, and
there take the road by the sea," said Deborah.</p>

<p>"Men might be more cruel than the beasts," was
the Arab's reply. "You cannot go alone. If I may
not accompany you, I must follow; for my father's
bidding I would not dare to disobey. He will require
of me an accounting of my safe conduct of you
to the fortress of your kinsman."</p>

<p>"Not if I myself release you from the duty."</p>

<p>"You cannot. Yusef is lord of these hills. Besides
you are his guest until the shadow of Masada itself
protects you. It shall never be said that ill has
befallen the daughter of Elkiah anywhere within the
echo of Yusef's or Nadan's bugle."</p>

<p>Deborah replied with look and tone that completely
won her companion:</p>

<p>"Sheikh Yusef is very gracious. The house of
Elkiah will ever remember his kindness this day,
and that of his son."</p>

<p>Nadan fell upon one knee, and kissed the hem of
her garment.</p>

<p>"I beg you then to lead the way at once," said
Deborah, "for we must hasten."</p>

<p>The Arab readjusted the saddle.</p>

<p>"I shall walk," said Deborah.</p>

<p>"That cannot be," replied the young man, catching
a glimpse of her broken sandal. "And see, even
Emir forbids it."</p>

<p>The horse had thrust his long nose into her hands.</p>

<p>"Emir&mdash;the Prince&mdash;and does he not deserve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
name?" said Nadan, who evidently shared his personal
conceit with his pride in his beast. "Emir's
stock is as old and pure as the fountain of Dûk by
the city of Jericho, whose waters they say your
prophet Elisha healed&mdash;Emir will have no other rider
to-day than yourself. See, he himself says so," for
the horse was rubbing his head against her shoulder.</p>

<p>Nadan made his hand the stirrup, and lifted Deborah
to the saddle.</p>

<p>"Were the daughter of Elkiah as ignorant of
horses as they say all Jerusalem women are, Emir
would carry you as safely as if he had arms, and
you lay within them. But you are no stranger to
the saddle. Come, Emir, we must be to-night at
Masada."</p>

<p>He patted the head of the horse.</p>

<p>"You remember, my Emir, the tournament you
had with Ben Aaron's Nagid, which means the same
as Emir? It was Prince against Prince indeed.
Our lady should have seen us that day. Eh,
Emir?"</p>

<p>The horse shook his long mane, pawed the ground,
and whinnied his challenge, as if his master's words
were the promise of another contest.</p>

<p>Nadan took the single rein and led the way.
Neither spoke for a long while. At length Deborah
gave a cry. Emir raised his head, and neighed like
the blast of a trumpet.</p>

<p>They had climbed to the summit of a high hill.
Before them stretched the plain of the Jordan. To
the north a silver thread ran through a vast tapestry
of green. To the south was the Sea of Salt, like
a shield of bronze inlaid with variegated precious
stones, so many were the hues which the soft and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
cloud-flecked light painted upon its surface. The
plain of Jordan lay thousands of feet beneath them,
a picture bordered on the east by the cliffs of Moab,
whose many-colored rocks gleamed like piled fragments
of a rainbow, and to the north by the white
shoulders of Hermon, like those of a maiden who
has not yet learned to shun the eyes of men.</p>

<p>Midway the scene were the gray walls and flattened
white domes of Jericho. Scattered here and
there, as far as the eye could reach, were clusters of
tents. In one group were hundreds of awning-like
structures made of black camel's hair. In another
group were pyramidal tents, some white, some
striped with orange or blue. In the distance these
flaxen towns, with green fig orchards or dusky
forests of olive for the background, gleamed like
dewdrops on outspread leaves.</p>

<p>Deborah's cry had been evoked partly by the magnificent
vision. Had Emir's big eyes detected the
tents of his master in the distance?</p>

<p>Nadan pointed out to Deborah the various camps.
The Jordan valley had become the rendezvous of the
warriors of many tribes, waiting the decision of the
Council of the Sheikhs for their contemplated raid
upon the Maccabæans.</p>

<p>"The camps will not break up to-morrow, as had
been planned, of that I am sure," said the guide.
"There has been much division of opinion among the
Sheikhs. Some distrust the Greeks more than they
hate the Jews; and the news from Jerusalem that
the Greeks have broken faith with those who, like
yourself, have gone over to them, will destroy all
zeal for helping the foreigners, as the dead water of
the Sea of Salt yonder kills the bushes on the shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
I would rather make alliance with Judas, for every
Bedouin loves a hero."</p>

<p>Nadan instantly repented this last sentence of his
speech, for he knew that the Hellenizing sect of the
Jews, to which he assumed that his companion belonged,
hated the Maccabæans. He glanced at her
face to meet her displeasure with apology. But no
frown was there. She even put her hand on Nadan's
shoulder as he stood by her saddle. He thought he
detected in her look a tender passion astir for himself;
for was he not a hero too?</p>

<p>"It is true that Judas is a wonderful warrior,"
said she. "And some claim more for him than skill
and bravery. His people deem him inspired. Even
in Jerusalem are those who avow that his victories
at the Wady and Bethhoron were given him by
Heaven. But what think you, Nadan? Is not all
genius to plan great deeds, and all heroism to execute
them, the gift of Heaven? I sometimes fear
lest, except among those Maccabæans, and your
own tribesmen, the world has forgotten how to be
great. Oh, to be a man, Nadan, and to wear armor,
and to ride a steed like Emir! It seems to me
that I would fight always in company with the
bravest and best, and call them the favored of
Heaven, whatever creed or kingdom they belonged
to. But it must be wrong to talk so."</p>

<p>The young man was intoxicated with his companion's
spirit. He cried enthusiastically:</p>

<p>"Wert thou a man! Ah, there were a chieftain I
would follow!"</p>

<p>Then catching his reward from her smile, his gallantry
became two-fold, as he added, "And I could
swear allegiance to the daughter of Elkiah, even if
she were not a man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are my protector," said Deborah, with dignified
rebuke in her tones. "Let us hasten on, I beg
you."</p>

<p>Nadan led the way. It was exceedingly rough.
They soon looked down into the awful gorge of the
lower Kedron, a gash hundreds of feet in depth, as
if some Titanic foe had endeavored to strike the
world to the heart. The eye could not detect room
for the path of a goat along its precipitous sides.
One might have said that an eagle would grow
dizzy in flying across the mighty chasm. But Nadan
led the way rapidly, followed by the sure feet of
Emir. The beast, as if mindful of the need of his
burden, picked his steps not only in the safest but
the easiest places. Down, down they went, from
ledge to ledge, through narrow crevices, now knee-deep
in the sandy débris lodged in seams of rock,
and now with sliding hoofs over brief declivities.
At the very bottom of the chasm they crossed the
fretting waters of the brook; then climbed the steep
wall of rock beyond.</p>

<p>When they reached the top another magnificent
view burst upon them. They were just above the
Sea of Salt, its blue surface gleaming amid the white
saline shores like a turquoise set in a circlet of silver.
Down, down again they went, until, two hours
later, they struck the level roadway along the very
edge of this vast bituminous pool. The sun was
past meridian, and soon the bold headlands of the
mountains of Engedi to the west would shut out the
light. On Deborah's insistence Nadan mounted behind
her; and giving Emir the rein they sped rapidly
southward. The glowing Sea of Death on the one
hand, and the terrible cliffs on the other, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
suppressed desire of conversation even if Deborah
had not been preoccupied with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>Dusk had already thickened the air about them,
leaving only the bright glow of fading daylight to
banner the mighty parapets of Moab across the sea,
when there arose by their side the tall pinnacle of
Masada&mdash;a single monolith penetrating the sky hundreds
of cubits above them. Its base was an immense
scarp ascended only by a narrow foot-path.
Here Emir was tethered, and sent his whinnying
salutation echoing among the rocks. Deborah
needed the strong hand of Nadan as they threaded
their way upward.</p>

<p>Near the summit the whole peak seemed cut off
from access. A fringe of jagged peaks stood about
the central cone, like the tents of a body-guard protecting
the pavilion of a militant monarch. Within
these natural towers the ground fell into a deep
moat. This was crossed by a narrow neck of higher
ground, an artificial viaduct admitting passage only in
single file, and flanked by deep and perilous declivities.</p>

<p>The travellers were fairly upon this natural bridge
when a score of forms rose behind them to dispute
their return, and as many more challenged their advance.
Ben Aaron lived in troublous times, and, as
a Jew among Moabite and Arabian tribes, held his
stronghold like an eagle's eyrie amid hostile beaks.</p>

<p>To the challenge the young Arab answered with
his name. A moment later appeared a tall man,
slightly bent with years. His restless gray eyes
suggested one who succeeded rather by caution than
by courage. He passed through the guard on the
castle side of the causeway, and, making deep
salaam, kissed the Arab upon both cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Lord be with thee, Nadan, son of Yusef!
What good intent has led you to climb so high?
There are no eggs in this nest for you to rob; and
if Ben Aaron had a brood of his own begetting they
would cackle their welcome to the boldest rider and
handsomest Sheikh of the plain. That Nadan knows
full well. Peace be with thee! But who have you
here? Some distressed soul of my people, I see from
her face. Yusef has a hard hand, but it is soft and
tender betimes. That I have often proved."</p>

<p>"I have brought to your protection this kinswoman,
the daughter of Elkiah of Jerusalem. My
father bids me deliver her to your hands, in token
of the peace that shall ever be between us," replied
the young Sheikh.</p>

<p>"Elkiah's daughter? Deborah? Child of Miriam
who was the child of Leah, our mother's sister?"</p>

<p>"I am Miriam's child," said the fugitive.</p>

<p>"I see it. I see it," replied Ben Aaron, pressing
the black locks back from her face. "And but that
Elkiah was richer than I, thou mightest have been
my daughter; and such thou shalt be now, for I
see there is need. Come, Nadan, you must break
bread with me."</p>

<p>"My father's command is that I do not loiter,"
replied the Arab. "Night is shutting in the way,
and I must be upon the high-road quickly, or even
my Emir's eyes will not find it."</p>

<p>"Then the Lord go with thee! And Jotham and
Joshua shall see you safely down to the seashore."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary."</p>

<p>"True, not for thee, but for Ben Aaron's hospitality.
My love to the noble Yusef! and my thanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
for this new mark of his goodness in giving me my
kinswoman."</p>

<p>The two men salaamed to the ground. Nadan
lifted the hand of Deborah to his lips. He looked
into her face as if he would have its fair features
stamped upon his soul, as a seal makes its impression
on wax.</p>

<p>Her returning glance, and the warmth of her gratitude,
though expressed in briefest sentence, "I thank
you, good Nadan," sent him away with something
else than a warrior's pride in his heart.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span> the form of Nadan was lost behind
the battlement of rocks, Ben Aaron
turned to Deborah.</p>

<p>"My child, why this coarse and torn
garb? I did not ask in the presence of
the Arab, lest the story might shame the good name
of the house of Elkiah. But come within, and tell
me in the confidence of our kinship; and as the Lord
liveth, if man hath harmed thee, I will plant my
spear before his tent ere the sun set again, though
he were Sheikh Yusef himself. But you are faint, my
daughter. You must rest; and, when refreshed with
the warm goat's milk and the meat, I must have
the tale of the happenings, even as if my ears were
those of Elkiah himself&mdash;the Lord rest his spirit!"</p>

<p>"Adah! Zillah!"</p>

<p>He clapped his hands, and serving-women came
from the low doorway of what was called the Castle
of Masada, but seemed to Deborah more like a covert
for cattle, so rude was the structure.</p>

<p>"Adah will bring water; and Zillah fetch you
the garments of wool; aye, and the leben will bring
warmth to your cheek."</p>

<p>Deborah evinced a moment's indecision. Her
wearied flesh clamored for the offered cheer, yet her
strong purpose prevailed.</p>

<p>"My thanks, Ben Aaron, but I have come upon a
mission that may not be delayed even by your hos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>pitality.
As the good servant of our father Abraham
at the house of Laban, so I must say to you,
my father's kinsman, 'I will not eat until I have told
mine errand.' And this raiment and these bleeding
feet are fitting to my story. If I find not favor
for my cause, then let me depart. You know that
my father's house has sided with the Greeks."</p>

<p>"And well; for why should they perish?" interrupted
her host.</p>

<p>"Say not so. The Greeks have turned to be enemies
of our people. I myself was a prisoner in my
father's house, doomed to death. I fled to the wilderness,
to the Arabs, until these, our ancient enemies,
less cruel than the Greeks, have brought me
here to you. There is no hope for our people in
this alliance with those who destroy our altars.
God has brought to confusion and shame and destruction
those of us who have consented to worship
their false gods. He saves only His true people.
Our hope is in the sons of Mattathias."</p>

<p>Ben Aaron raised his hand in protest.</p>

<p>"Nay," continued the eager woman, "hear me.
The sons of Mattathias are the arrows of our God.
Already He has sped them with His strength. If
the arch of the sky were His bow and the lightning
His arrows, the Greeks had not been smitten
more disastrously. Without human aid Judas has
already overthrown two armies of the heathen. I
know that he will soon meet a third. If then Judas
be beaten, the Greeks swear by their gods that no
Jew, whatever may have been his alliance with
Antiochus, shall live in the land. This fortress, as
you know, is not safe even from the arrows and
swords of the valley Sheikhs; how can it withstand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the engines of war with which the Greeks batter
down walls and towers? But if Judas be again
victorious, then the Romans will send armies to
his assistance. Of this he already has assurance.
The blood of Aaron and Elkiah is that of the sons
of Mattathias."</p>

<p>"This is strange tidings," said Ben Aaron. "Come
within the lamp-light that I may see if fright has
not robbed you of your wits, my daughter."</p>

<p>Deborah stood beneath the rays under the rude
portal. Ben Aaron caught the vision of her superb
face, as she said:</p>

<p>"Think you that fright drove me through the wilderness
of the Kedron and Engedi, when I might
have fled to the camp of Judas? I have come, my
kinsman, because our faith, our blood, is one. My
father, Elkiah, said that Ben Aaron would protect
his children."</p>

<p>"And so he will! And so he will!" cried Ben
Aaron vehemently.</p>

<p>"It is impossible that I abide here," continued
Deborah. "This stronghold is itself doomed. The
Arabs of the valley are already gathering like eagles
waiting for a carcass. I myself heard Yusef mutter
curses on the name of Ben Aaron, and that, too,
in the ears of his son Nadan. Did not Nadan but
now refuse to break bread with you? Why should
he break bread with you when to-morrow his tribe
may feast here at will, and no Ben Aaron be living
to bid them either welcome or begone? What means
the gathering of all the tribes in the great plain?
Their tents gleam from Jericho to Galilee almost as
continuously as the sacred river itself. Will Ben
Aaron submit?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The man stood rigid, his hands clenched, his eyes
drinking her spirit as he watched her and heard
her heroic appeal.</p>

<p>"I have ten score men," said he, as if speaking
to himself. "Bethuel, too, has bidden me beware
the tribesmen. Bethuel is my Captain; a
braver or wiser man never threw spear. I would
have speech with him. You will tell me more, my
daughter, as we are at meat."</p>

<p>"But tell me first," she insisted, "has my errand
found favor with you? If not, I will go alone to
the Maccabæans."</p>

<p>"I cannot answer you nay, my daughter. But
you shall tell it all to Bethuel. Is it not enough
for the moment that Deborah has found favor with
her kinsman, and that his life shall be for hers
whether she go or stay? Aye, you have Miriam's
face. Know you, my child, that when you were
born your father pledged me that you should become
the bride of my Josiah, whom the Lord so soon
after took from me. Since the same plague struck
down the lad and his mother, Ben Aaron has lived
a lonely life, overlooking this Sea of Death, for so
it seemed fitting for one with a desolate heart, and
no wife nor child to cheer it. The Lord has sent
you to me, my child. No other angel have I seen
on this barren peak. Let Bethuel say why I should
not go with you."</p>

<p>If care and kindly purpose could have recuperated
the strength of the traveller, the hands of Adah and
Zillah would have taken away all aches. But ablution
in the water cooled by filtering through the
coarse clay jars, and the savory supper, only allayed
her excitement. As she began to rest she for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
first time began to realize how utterly wearied she
was. She begged Ben Aaron that she might sleep
until the morning; in the meantime he and Bethuel
should consider the answer he was to give.</p>

<p>The news Deborah had brought spread like fire
in the brambles throughout the little colony, for
such it was rather than a single household. Scores
of herdsmen that night gathered in the great central
chamber. This was built of unhewn and unmortared
stones, the débris of the storm-shattered
crags about the summit of Masada.</p>

<p>It was the supper hour. Great pots steamed with
the parched corn boiling in milk. Two whole goats,
only the entrails having been removed, were being
roasted on great wooden spits over the fire in the
centre of the room. The savor of their flesh, mingled
with the smoke, poured through the opening in the
roof. This was an incense pleasing, if not to the
gods, surely to the thousands of rooks collected
upon the dried mud interlaced with sticks which
made the roof.</p>

<p>Around the great chamber were sheds, from which
came the lowing of cattle and the cries of the milkers.
Without could be heard the clattering of wooden
shoes on the rocks as the herdsmen clambered up
from a lower plateau where the sheep were folded
for the night.</p>

<p>Bethuel was closeted with his master in an adjacent
room. The noise of the feasters ceased until
each one threw himself down in his blanket upon
the earthen floor. Then the voices of Ben Aaron
and his chief broke the stillness. The debate had
evidently been serious, for Bethuel exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is the hour I have warned my lord must come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Our flocks are constantly stolen. Our herders are
assaulted except as they go in bands. The tribesmen
no longer keep faith with us. The Greeks&mdash;have
I not often said it?&mdash;could not protect us if they
would. The daughter of Elkiah has come to us as
the angel to the threshing-floor of Gideon. We need
no miracle of the dew on the fleece, and no fire
to burst from the rock, to tell us the will of the
Lord. Our God is with Judas and his brethren.
The maiden's voice is His call from afar."</p>

<p>"Bethuel was always over-ready to fight," replied
Ben Aaron.</p>

<p>"And," retorted Bethuel, "Ben Aaron has too long
been, as the Arabs are everywhere saying, like a
sick eagle on his nest. What is all the gold my lord
has stored between these walls? My master's wealth
and fame are like yonder nail that has rusted in
the wall, and will scarcely hold the weight of his
armor."</p>

<p>"It is true. It is true. Bethuel, my grief has aged
me. I am but a rusted nail. But the words of
Bethuel and my kinswoman have touched me with
youth again. Bethuel, we will fight. Do you remember,
my son, how we used to fight? How we
won these heights for our castle? How many years
have gone? Summon my people, Bethuel. It were
better to fall in war than to die here. Summon the
people, Bethuel!"</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was the fifth day since Deborah's disappearance.
No tidings had come to
make even a rift in the cloud on Judas'
brow. Toward noon scouts, who had
been sent to the Jordan to discover any
possible trace of kidnapping by the tribesmen, returned
with the reports that the camps, which had
rapidly formed in the valley, had as suddenly broken
up, the Sheikhs retiring east or north to their separate
pasture lands.</p>

<p>"The Lord be praised!" said Judas. "It can only
have been by the interposition of an angel; for
Yusef the Arabian, I know, had sworn to assail us,
and for this and this only the tribes were gathered.
Let us hope for the maiden."</p>

<p>"How does this portend her safety?" asked Simon.
"If the tribesmen have gone, may they not have
taken her with them or slain her?"</p>

<p>"True," replied Judas, "but if the Lord will that
we shall be delivered from their menace, then He has
not deserted our cause, as I confess my sins made
me fear; and why should He spare us, and allow
harm to come to the maiden?"</p>

<p>Simon mused anxiously a moment before he answered:</p>

<p>"Does Judas love the daughter of Elkiah? Has the
sentiment of swains turned her skirts into those of
an angel? Beware, my brother. Every man has his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
vulnerable spot. It is not timely for our Samson to
be shorn of his locks."</p>

<p>Judas' face blazed with rage. His lips were
clenched as if their resolute keeper could with difficulty
bar the egress of lawless words. But slowly
the color faded from his countenance. He turned
away, addressing only himself:</p>

<p>"She will come yet!"</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken when, over the shoulder of
the hill of Gibeah, appeared the familiar outline of
the Bedouin steed and the thread-like lance. But
from the uplifted point floated the pennant denoting
the peaceful intent of the comer, who rode leisurely
on. Judas himself went to meet him.</p>

<p>"Peace be to you!"</p>

<p>"Peace!"</p>

<p>The rider dismounted, and, planting his lance,
bowed low to the ground.</p>

<p>"I am Nadan, son of Yusef. My father bids me
say, 'Let there be peace between him and the son of
Mattathias."</p>

<p>"Let there be peace!" responded Judas.</p>

<p>He picked from the ground a round stone, broke
it in twain upon a rock, and gave the half to
Nadan.</p>

<p>"Nay, let me give better pledge of our covenant,"
said the young man. "The highway from Jericho is
this hour filled with the herds of Ben Aaron of
Masada, and ten score men are coming to you."</p>

<p>"The road is dangerous for so few," interjected
Judas.</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Nadan, "since this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He held in his hand a piece of stone not dissimilar
to that Judas had given him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ben Aaron holds the other half. Is it enough?"</p>

<p>Judas' face revealed an instant of incredulity; but
the eager frankness of the young man dispelled it.</p>

<p>"It is enough," he replied. "When Masada falls of
its own weight into the sea then the covenant of the
son of Yusef may be broken."</p>

<p>"My thanks," said Nadan, "and since I have
found some favor, I would ask for more."</p>

<p>"You have but to speak it."</p>

<p>"Son of Mattathias, the house of Elkiah in Jerusalem
is in alliance with the Greeks."</p>

<p>"It is true."</p>

<p>"That may be broken."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Elkiah's daughter is fair, and she pleases me,"
said Nadan, a blush blending finely with his proud
mien.</p>

<p>"You have seen her?"</p>

<p>"She has been in my power."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>Had not Nadan's eyes been upon the ground he
would have detected something in Judas which
would have halted his proposal; but he continued:</p>

<p>"She has been in my power. I could have carried
her to my tent, yet I delivered her to her kinsman.
She comes with his men."</p>

<p>A sunburst could not have changed Judas' aspect
more than did the glad news. Nadan quite naturally
misinterpreted it as an evidence of the favor
with which the Maccabæan received his proposal,
and he enthusiastically pursued his scheme.</p>

<p>"I could have taken her to my tent, for she was
mine. But, son of Mattathias, I have wider
thoughts for us both. With the tribesmen as your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
allies you can hold this land. Quickly the city will
fall. Two thousand spears will follow the call of
Yusef or his son. These you may have if you give
me the daughter of Elkiah to wife, and assure me of
the property of that house as her dowry."</p>

<p>"The woman is not mine to give," said Judas.</p>

<p>"Then the easier it is to give her," was the Arab's
response. "When she was in my power I could have
made the alliance of the tribesmen with the Greek
on the same condition, for they have offered us ten
times the amount of Elkiah's estate for our aid
against you. Why did we not accept it? Because,
son of Mattathias, the tribesmen prefer to live in
fellowship with the Jews, for a thousand years our
neighbors in the land, bound to us by the ties of
intermarriage since the Moabite Ruth wedded the
ancestor of your great King David. The Greeks are
foreign to us. To make my marriage with this fair
woman the seal of perpetual peace with the Jews
by helping them reconquer this land, for this I gave
up the daughter of Elkiah as my spoil that I might
have her as a gift from your hands. I have already
the consent of her kinsman, Ben Aaron, waiting
only upon that of the son of Mattathias."</p>

<p>Nadan awaited Judas' answer with bowed head,
an attitude of obsequious courtesy, which, however,
did not conceal the hauteur of the man, or his reserved
purpose of swift and vengeful retaliation if
his scheme were not acceded to.</p>

<p>Judas pondered, and after some moments replied
slowly:</p>

<p>"Son of Yusef, the tribesmen have been of old both
the foes and friends of my people. I would make
them only friends, that in peace we might both con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>tinue
to possess these lands our God gave to our
fathers. You have my pledge&mdash;if&mdash;if the woman
shall consent."</p>

<p>"Of that I have no fear," replied the young man,
grasping Judas' hand. "Within a week I will return,
a hundred of my young men with me, to escort
the fairest of women to the wedding tent by the
bank of the Jordan. And then, son of Mattathias,
I will come again with thousands of our bravest;
aye, all the Moab and the north men from as far as
Bosrah and Bashan will come at the call of Yusef
and Nadan."</p>

<p>The rhapsodic speech of the young Sheikh was
broken by the clatter of a crutch and an outcry:</p>

<p>"They're coming! The men of Masada, and Deborah&mdash;Deborah's
with them!"</p>

<p>Over the hill appeared the head of an advancing
company of men.</p>

<p>The Jews ran in crowds to meet them.</p>

<p>Ben Aaron was received with wild ovation. Every
man in his following was greeted with huzza and
embrace.</p>

<p>For Deborah the reception was as reverent as it
was joyous. The little mule upon which she was
seated could hardly keep his feet as the multitude
thronged about her, seeking her hand, patting the
beast, and gazing with tearful eyes upon the woman
whom they had learned almost to worship as an
impersonation of their nation's cause.</p>

<p>Nadan stood far aside, perplexed by this scene.
"This woman," he said to himself, "cannot be the
person she claimed to be. No Elkiah's daughter,
no fugitive from Jerusalem is she. A spy of the
Maccabæans! I see it all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>When Deborah recognized him, her manner was
so warmly and frankly grateful to her protector
that the Arab became bewildered, and reversed his
thoughts. He deemed it impossible that one so
fair, with those eyes lustrous with sincerity, could
be aught else than what she said. Who? What was
she?</p>

<p>Nadan's indecision was ended quickly when Judas
saluted her. While the champion observed due formality,
he was also as familiar as her father or a
lover might have been in the presence of others.
Nadan's own sense of enchantment by her beauty
made him keen to detect what he thought to be the
same feeling in Judas.</p>

<p>"Well did the wily Jew leave the choice to the
woman herself, for he knew her decision," Nadan
thought almost aloud. "Why did I not test the
success of my errand by casting some gift into the
spring of Dûk? The sacred dragon of the waters
would have drifted it away, and thus I should have
known of the deceit."</p>

<p>The Arab leaped upon his horse. With almost the
celerity of a whirling simitar he turned Emir about
in a circle. Rising in his stirrups, he twirled the
spear around his head, and hurled it.</p>

<p>"Death to the Maccabæan!"</p>

<p>The weapon sped like a gleam of light to the spot
where Deborah and Judas stood together. Before
the crowd were fully aware of his movement the
Arab had dashed through them, and was in flight.
A single arrow close to his head sang its reply to
his taunt.</p>

<p>Judas had seen the launching of Nadan's spear,
and thrust Deborah behind him. He fended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
missile by instantly bending, and with his arm diverted
its direction. The spear glanced upward
from his cuirass, and, curving like a swallow in the
air, fell with broken shaft amid the rocks a hundred
cubits beyond.</p>

<h2>XXXV<br />

<span class="smaller">WORSHIP BEFORE BATTLE</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-d.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Deborah's</span> story of her adventure, of
the diversion of the tribesmen from
their purpose of attacking Judas, and
the strengthening of the Maccabæans
by the addition of the men of Masada,
would have filled the remainder of the day and
night with interest, without the other and more
startling news that was brought them. Scouts
came in with the report that General Gorgias had
made forced marches through Galilee, and was already
upon the plain of Esdraelon, so often the
battle-field in the history of Israel's resistance to
northern nations. A day's march would bring the
Greek armies as far south as Emmaus, nearly west
of the Maccabæan encampment.</p>

<p>The imminence of another battle now filled Judas
with a strange gladness. He was possessed by a
presentiment of victory. Others could not understand
the change that had taken place in him, but
all caught his spirit. He was called the "Heart of
Israel," and as the quickness or sluggishness of the
natural heart is registered in every nerve, even to the
extremities of the body, so the great leader seemed
to impart his own personality to every soldier.</p>

<p>To those immediately about him he thus accounted
for his confidence:</p>

<p>"God is surely with us. Nothing less than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
miracle could have preserved the life of the maiden
and scattered the tribesmen; for well I knew the
preparations they had made to strike us."</p>

<p>"But will they not reassemble at Nadan's call?"
asked Jonathan.</p>

<p>"Not in time to harm us in the coming battle.
See how the Lord will turn the skill of man to his
discomfiture. General Gorgias is a fast fighter. He
is famed for the rapidity with which he hurls his
armies. He will not loiter in the plain. If I mistake
not his tactics, he will essay to strike our camps
even before he has made his own. If he were an
Apollonius or a Seron it might be days before he
would hazard a battle, in which event the tribesmen
could have time to gather. But Gorgias will
be too quick for them to help him. But here is the
maiden."</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Micah of Hebron?" asked
Deborah. "I brake bread with him some weeks ago,
when I was supposed to be nursing my convenient
malady under the care of Huldah."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Judas, "four score of his men reached
us yester nightfall. They are the best archers in the
south country."</p>

<p>"And the men from Kirjath-jearim?"</p>

<p>"They, too, have joined us. They will fight on
familiar ground, for Gorgias will certainly take the
broad ascent from the plain, and not repeat Seron's
mistake on the high-road."</p>

<p>"The physician Samuel," added Deborah, "has
also done us some service. His fame called him as
far north as the Waters of Meron, and he saw most
of the herdsmen between here and there."</p>

<p>"And some of them have joined us," replied Judas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
"but I do not trust them as I do those of the southern
country. They have not felt the King's cruelty
as others have. They are, however, of splendid
spirit. I have assigned them some desperate work,
for in a man naturally brave nothing breeds loyalty
like danger."</p>

<p>At that moment one came hastily reporting that
a change was being made in the disposition of the
Greek forces. Judas held a brief conversation with
the scout. Turning, he said:</p>

<p>"Gorgias will undoubtedly climb the ascent to-night.
I must away. One thing I ask of you, Deborah."</p>

<p>"Your wish is your command to me, Judas."</p>

<p>"You must not linger near this battle."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid."</p>

<p>"Would God that you were afraid, Deborah; that
in this one respect you were like other women."</p>

<p>"Would you esteem me more, Judas, if I were like
other women?"</p>

<p>"Deborah, if you were like other women, like any
other woman in the world, the world would be less
to me. No, be your own self; only do not remain
here. If harm should come to you, I should lose
heart. You cheer me. You inspire me. Take no risk."</p>

<p>"But have I not cared for myself at other times?"</p>

<p>"True: yet the battle to-morrow will not be as
the others. Gorgias is experienced, the most tactful,
the most desperate of all the Greek generals. He
will not stand on the defensive, but make his own
battle. If in the night he should get his forces to
the ridge, the fight will be here, or between this
and Jerusalem. If he should be worsted, he will
be succored by two other armies as great as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
own. Promise me that you will not even see this
battle, for I know too well that if you so much as
look you will be drawn into some danger."</p>

<p>"For your sake, Judas, I will be as other women.
The Lord gird you with His strength for the morrow!"</p>

<p>"Your prayer is a prophecy. It gives me strength
already. Farewell!"</p>

<p>Deborah sat with little Caleb's hand in hers. The
sun was going down. The red orb hung over the
Great Sea, transforming the watery horizon into a
glorious carpet fitting the feet of the King of Day,
and making the sky his canopy of gold.</p>

<p>"Where are we now, sister?" asked the lad. "I
hear a rustling as if the trees were moving together."</p>

<p>"Not trees, brother, but men are gathering. By
the side of us is Mizpah, where, in the time of the
prophet Samuel, the whole nation came together.
I would that your eyes were open to see."</p>

<p>"But your eyes are mine, sister. What shall I
look at?"</p>

<p>"Well, stand so. Now we see toward the sunrise
the far-away mountains of Gilead and Moab. How
beautiful! The great wall of rock rises into the sky.
It flashes with color, almost like the floor of heaven
which Moses and the seventy elders saw. Now turn&mdash;you
are facing the north."</p>

<p>"Aye, I see old Hermon with his helmet of snow,
and the cloud plumes floating from the top of it,"
cried the lad, as if his eyes had really opened.</p>

<p>"Now turn again&mdash;you are looking south. Here,
almost at our feet, lies Jerusalem. Yet it was a
long way to come, wasn't it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not when Jonathan carried me, and I was
asleep," laughed Caleb.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Deborah, "the white roads and the
black stones in the fields, the gray of olive and the
green of fig-trees between here and the city walls,
look like a dream floating between two waking moments.
And beyond the city is Bethlehem. And
now turn this way&mdash;the way the sun is going.
Down there we can see Lydda, as a pearl on a gray
robe; and way off is Joppa, a dot on the shore of
the Great Sea which looks like a blazing serpent
with his back in the sky. Here is the plain of
Sharon filled again with soldiers under the great
generals Gorgias and Ptolemy and Nicanor. We
can see the smoke, for they are making their camps.
And we are on the side of Mount Mizpah, where
once the Holy Tabernacle stood before Solomon
built the Temple. And look, child; everywhere the
brave men of Israel are coming&mdash;for Judas has bidden
the people with him to spend the rest of the
day in prayer. Listen! Quite near us is a company
of soldiers. They have laid down their spears
and bows and swords, and have covered their heads
with dust. They are repeating together the Psalms
of Penitence, and praying God not to visit the sins
of Israel upon the land. Let us go nearer. They
are now spreading on the ground the copy of the
Books of the Law, that which Dion brought me one
day, and which he found in the High Priest's house;
the one in letters of silver and gold once encased in
the beautiful ark with clasps of precious stone,
but now with its holiest words cut out, and the
margins covered over with pictures of heathen gods.
Now the men are praying that the land may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
restored to Israel; and they vow&mdash;every man&mdash;to
keep all the precepts of the Law as our fathers did.</p>

<p>"Now what are they doing? They are holding up
toward heaven some garments which belonged to
the priests whom the Greeks have murdered."</p>

<p>"I can hear their words!" said the boy. "It is
'Lord, so perish the priests of the heathen!' How
wild their cry is! Is any one coming to attack
them?"</p>

<p>"No, my child. Their voices are harsh, being tuned
for battle-cries on the morrow."</p>

<p>"But, listen, sister, some one is reading in a mocking
voice."</p>

<p>"That," replied Deborah, "is a proclamation of
the King which is posted on the gates of Antioch, a
copy of which has found its way into our camp."</p>

<p>A soldier read:</p>

<p>"But now they have changed," said Caleb. "Now
they are wailing."</p>

<p>"Yes, Simon, son of Mattathias, has piled together
all the tithes of fruits, which the men have brought,
and they are begging the Lord with tears to accept
them, though they have no altar on which to put
the offering."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hear the words they are saying," said Caleb.
"'Lord, Lord, what shall we do with these things
since the heathen have broken down thine altars?'
Shall we go and pray with them, sister?"</p>

<p>"Let us pray here," said Deborah.</p>

<p>Long time they bowed to the earth, the lad kneeling
by her side, his arm thrown about her, and the
blind eyes flashing with his imagination of armies
and victories.</p>

<p>"Come, let us go!" said Deborah, rising.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go?"</p>

<p>"To Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"Why, sister! Not again to the city. Dion is
gone, and our brother Benjamin too, and only Greek
soldiers are waiting to kill you."</p>

<p>"Yes, child, to the city, to our father's house. I
believe&mdash;Lord help my faith!&mdash;that on the morrow
Israel will triumph, and we will welcome Judas the
Deliverer, perhaps as the Messiah&mdash;for such he seems
to me. But if we triumph not, there will be no need
to flee elsewhere. The sons of Mattathias will first
perish in the battle, and all the hosts of Israel with
them; and we will perish too. But let it be in our
father's house. Yet whether we live or die I owe it
to our friend, the good Dion, to go back to Jerusalem.
He is in peril for our sakes. The Greeks may
slay him for letting me go. But if I show them that
I have not escaped, Dion may be saved."</p>

<p>"Then let us go to Jerusalem," said Caleb, grasping
his sister's hand. "Let us go."</p>

<p>They went a little way in silence except for the
murmur of the multitude at worship, which at
length died away in the distance. They sat down to
rest amid the gray stones of the hillside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hark!" said the lad, "that's Meph!"</p>

<p>"I hear nothing," replied Deborah. Caleb put his
fingers to his mouth, and imitated the three notes of
the quail.</p>

<p>"He hears. He is answering. There he has stumbled
and dropped his crutch. He's up again now."</p>

<p>"I hear nothing," repeated Deborah; but in another
moment a sun-faded mat of hair was projected
from over an adjacent rock.</p>

<p>"I thought that would bring you," shouted the
lame boy, "that is, if you were anywhere on the
outside of your stone cage&mdash;that's what I call Jerusalem.
I have been whistling for an hour, like a
bird left behind when the flock has flown southward,
and I couldn't call up a mate. But my! it's
good to see you, Caleb, and to-morrow Judas is
going to whack the Greeks again. He knows how
to fight. Did you ever see&mdash;of course you didn't,
but I did&mdash;a little red ant fight a big black ant?
Before black ant can turn, red ant rushes at him
and bites him in two in the middle where his back
is as thin as his legs; then he falls to and eats up
the pieces. That's the way Judas fights. You'll see
to-morrow or next day; for the Greeks are coming,
sure; and Judas is lying for them, just as he did at
Bethhoron."</p>

<p>So Meph's tongue and his crutch rattled on for an
hour.</p>

<p>Nearing the city, Deborah and Caleb concealed
themselves behind the rocks, or wandered, as the
women and children do picking dried brambles for
kindling. Meph in the meanwhile acted as a scout,
and gave warning of every moving shadow in the
distance. Only once did he sound any real alarm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
It was when several horsemen dashed from the direction
of Emmaus, and made for the west gate of
the city. After a while our wayfarers cautiously
approached the northwest corner of the wall, and
disappeared in the crevice. Meph came out alone,
and after beating the bushes wildly with his crutch
hobbled off, muttering all sorts of imprecations on
game that will not stand to be caught.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE TEMPTRESS</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> house of Elkiah had been measurably
cleansed when Deborah emerged from
the cellar and passed unobserved
through the concealed stairway to her
own chamber. Next day she came
down into the court. A fawn could not have been
more timid amid its captors than Deborah seemed
as, with apparent surprise and startled look, she
emerged amid a group of Greek soldiers whom
Meton had left to guard the property. Equally
amazed were the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Do not harm me. I will go back," cried Deborah,
with tremulous voice.</p>

<p>"We'll not harm you," said an awkward man
who was in command of the squad. He attempted
a courtesy, which was half a military salute and
half an act of gallantry such as in his peasant days
he had practised upon country maidens. In executing
these difficult tactics he let fall his sarissa, the
iron head of which came in such perilous proximity
to Deborah that it seemed to belie his words.</p>

<p>"We'll not harm you, lady. We have no orders
about you, seeing that the General didn't know you
were here."</p>

<p>"You will be kind to me, truly?" she begged.</p>

<p>"By all the gods, yes! Stand back, men!"</p>

<p>"I was afraid to come out of the place Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Dion hid me in when the Jews took the house. I
heard the men shouting, and thought they were
searching for me." She trembled like a child.</p>

<p>"No, lady, we were not looking for you, for we
supposed you had got away," replied the good-natured
pikeman. "We have taken out the dead
soldiers which were piled pretty thick hereabouts,
and some of them stuffed into corners where they
have died like rats in their holes. But it's all cleaned
up now, except the smell&mdash;blood smell always lasts
until the moon changes. The cracks between the
pavement stones are red, but we'll have them
scraped too. But it was a pity to have knocked the
arm off Aphrodite. The man that did that will
never win himself a wife&mdash;or the goddess has no
more blood in her than her statue has. It might
have been your arm, lady, if Captain Dion hadn't
hid you. I'll off to the citadel and tell the General
that the Captain didn't let you escape. I knew he
wouldn't. Captain Dion is the bravest of the whole
garrison, and Meton ought never to have ordered a
better man than himself under arrest. When Governor
Lysias hears of it he ought to give Dion the
castle, and send Meton to command the camels and
ass drivers."</p>

<p>Deborah went to Glaucon's apartment. As she
approached she heard voices. A glance between the
curtains gave a picture of the pale face of her
brother, and close to it that of the Princess. She
was beautiful; yes, Deborah thought, as the head of
a serpent on its arching neck, with its rainbow eyes
charming its victim. The Princess' right arm was
about the Jew's shoulder; her left hand on his,
which gripped tightly a silken bag. This Deborah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
recognized as that in which the jewels of the house of
Elkiah were always kept.</p>

<p>"There is no other way, my dearest Glaucon, than
that I propose," said Helena, half embracing him.
"Menelaos is determined to have all you possess.
Give me these&mdash;no, I will not ask that&mdash;but let me
care for them. I can conceal them on my person.
We will leave Jerusalem. In Antioch we can live
together. The races, the dances, the wines, and all
the pleasures of the world are there. If we tire of
these things as they are in Syria, we may go to
Rome, where half of what we have here will suffice
for a lifetime. In Rome princes and princesses are
known by their jewels and equipages, and no one
searches for ancestry any more than for the pedigree
of a beautiful horse."</p>

<p>Glaucon clutched the bag. At length he opened it.</p>

<p>"You may have some of them," he said. "This
brooch of pearls was once worn by Arsinoë, sister of
the great Ptolemy Philadelphus, King of Egypt. It
came to my grandfather, who had made many loans
of convenience to the house of Ptolemy, which were
never paid. This cluster of diamonds belonged to
the great Joseph, the tax-gatherer, whose palace of
white marble is beyond Jordan. He needed a vast
sum of ready money in order to buy the office of
farmer of the revenues of Syria when our land was
under Egypt. He outwitted a whole company of
merchants from Tyre by offering single-handed more
than they all together. It was my grandfather who
advanced to Joseph the needed gold&mdash;which, of
course, never was returned, as our possession of his
jewels shows. Joseph had nothing finer than these
in all his marble castle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>One by one the gems slipped from Glaucon's fingers
into those of the Princess.</p>

<p>"And that! Oh, how magnificent!" cried she, as
he drew a necklace of scores of precious stones, and
spread it into shape upon the ebony table.</p>

<p>"That I must never part with. It was my
mother's, and now is Debor&mdash;Berenice's," said Glaucon,
gripping the necklace with hesitating fingers.</p>

<p>"But she can never claim it, now that she has
gone over to the traitors, and is herself outlawed,"
argued the temptress.</p>

<p>"Yet it is hers," replied Glaucon, his voice softening
as if a tear was diffused through it. "I cannot
part with it."</p>

<p>"Glaucon, my love!" cried the Princess, taking his
face between her hands, and kissing him upon the
lips.</p>

<p>Deborah threw aside the curtain, and stood before
the frightened couple.</p>

<p>"You monster!" cried she.</p>

<p>Both started from the seat. Deborah grasped the
jewels which had fallen from the fingers of the
startled Princess. The woman quickly recovered her
self-possession.</p>

<p>"The traitress! The traitress! Ho, guards!"</p>

<p>"The strumpet of Antioch, how dare she come
into the house of Elkiah?" retorted Deborah.</p>

<p>"By better right, I take it, than the Jewish spy,"
replied Helena.</p>

<p>"Glaucon, command her to leave this house," cried
Deborah.</p>

<p>The coward imitated the chameleon, which
changes its color according to the object that reflects
the light upon it; for, as he looked from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to the other of these women, he became for the moment
the victim of each, and dared to decide for
neither.</p>

<p>"If Glaucon will not purge his house of this refuse
of the camp of Apollonius, then will I, that our
mother's memory be not polluted. Begone!" She
raised the curtain and pointed to the exit.</p>

<p>The Princess' dignity gave way before the indignant
gaze of Deborah, as weak plants wither in
the scorching rays of the sun. Still she moved
not.</p>

<p>"Must I compel you?" Deborah exclaimed. She
dexterously drew from Glaucon's side his sword,
ere he could interpose, and poised it at the throat
of her enemy.</p>

<p>"Your paramour Apollonius once quailed before
the sword of the daughter of Elkiah. How shall
I spare this miserable remnant of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The terrified woman did not wait for the completion
of either the sentence or the threatened action.
She ran shrieking from the chamber, and fell into
the arms of&mdash;Dion.</p>

<p>For a moment the Captain held her; his surprise
and the dimness of the passageway not being favorable
to the clear vision of one who had emerged
from the brilliant light of the open court. The Captain
was the soul of gallantry to all of the fair sex,
but the Princess and Deborah were in such utter
contrast in his mind that the discovery of the unexpected
personality in his arms wrought a spasmodic
revulsion in his feeling. He loosened her embrace
and flung her from him. This time she found
a more solid anchorage for her fright&mdash;in the arms
of Thersites, a Greek common soldier, who held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
also a mop with which he had been cleansing the
statue of Aphrodite.</p>

<p>Thersites, being just then of less perturbable temper
than Dion, or perhaps being more experienced
in catching fleeing women, retained his captive long
enough to grunt his gratitude with a kiss upon her
cheek, entirely oblivious to the fact that such privileges
the fair Helena had often sold as high as three
shekels apiece in the market of Antioch.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XXXVII<br />

<span class="smaller">"IF I WERE A JEW"</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> mutual welcome of Deborah and Dion
was in briefest words, for each knew
more of its occasion than either cared
to express; therefore the appearance of
the Princess upon the scene served as a
convenient diversion for both. Deborah told of the
woman's attempt to beguile her brother, without
intimating how she herself had come just in time to
save this human moth from shrivelling his wings
in the flame.</p>

<p>"How could she have thought to deceive you,
Glaucon," said Dion, "after she had so completely
unmasked her character at the dance? None but a
stupid fool, or one as wicked as herself, would be
tempted by her wiles after that."</p>

<p>The speaker did not notice that the Jew winced
under his words.</p>

<p>"You may mistake her," replied Glaucon, as soon
as he had ceased to shrink into himself, and recovered
enough outward wit to say anything. "That
she danced is no more against the dignity of a
Princess, than it is for Antiochus to play the buffoon
along the streets of Antioch, as we both saw
him do in the great procession."</p>

<p>"Whatever she may be, she goes out of the city
very soon," replied Dion. "The kinsfolk of Apollonius
have heard of her claim, and have denounced
her to the Governor Lycias."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Glaucon, having gathered up the scattered jewels,
wrapped them each in its linen covering, and put
them into the bag; then withdrew with mutterings,
which it is uncertain if they were against his
mistress or her exposers.</p>

<p>The shell fringes of the curtain had not ceased
their jangling as Glaucon passed through them before
Dion cast himself at Deborah's feet.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Deborah, are you human, or a divinity?
You are risking your life to save me from harm.
Is this from a woman's misjudgment, or from a motive
which only the gods can understand and give?"</p>

<p>"Dion," replied she, with offended mien, "rise.
You shall not assume such an attitude before a
girl of the Jews&mdash;a mere child, whose gratefulness
you have chanced to win by your kindness."</p>

<p>"But why, Deborah, why this awful sacrifice you
are venturing? Soon General Gorgias will be here.
He is as cruel as an avalanche when his purpose
moves, and he has sworn to leave not so much as
a bone of a Jewish child outside the valley of Hinnom.
That you are the daughter of Elkiah, chief
of the Sanhedrin, is sufficient to excite his vengeance,
even without the stories of your escapades as a spy,
with which Menelaos' party are filling all ears.
There is no hope for you here. Vanish again, I beseech
you, as mysteriously as you will, for I cannot
endure that you should become a sacrifice for me.
I entreat it, Deborah. Go away again!"</p>

<p>"Why," replied she, "that would make the matter
worse, my good friend. It is known, or soon
will be, that I am now here; but if I disappear
again it will bring new accusation against you for
being in some collusion with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"I care nothing for such accusation. I would
willingly die in the tower with the sweet thought
that you were safe from insult and danger," cried
the soldier passionately.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Dion, I think there is need of
neither of us playing tragedy. Maybe, as you say,
I can vanish at will. If so, I shall always be safe,
and then, when you are in danger, I can reappear,
and they will say, 'Dion has guarded his prisoner
faithfully!'"</p>

<p>Deborah became quite merry with her pleasant
conceit.</p>

<p>Dion could not help catching some of the lighter
manner of his companion. He took both her hands.</p>

<p>"I pray you, do not vanish quite yet. Tell me
what motive led you to do this desperate deed in
my behalf? You will not love me?"</p>

<p>He paused, gazing quizzically at her, but drew
from her face not a flicker of such sentiment as certain
past experience had led him to hope for.</p>

<p>"Then, since you do not love me, your action was
prompted only by humane motives, to save a
wretched Greek from some inconvenience; and for
this you risk your life? I cannot understand you."</p>

<p>"Dion," replied Deborah, all mirth now gone from
her manner, "Dion, I am a Jewess. Think not that
our people's vows are only to save our land and
nation. We serve these because these stand for
Jehovah's law of righteousness and justice. Would
it be right for me to leave you to suffer unjustly for
my sake? I would be unfaithful to Jewry to so
treat even a Greek. Your philosophy may teach
you how to evade such questions, but our Jewish
law is simple and plain. It commands us to 'do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our
God.' We need speak of no other sentiment."</p>

<p>Her eyelashes did quiver a little as she said this.</p>

<p>Then, looking him fairly in the face and returning
the strong grasp of his hands, she added: "If
my sense of duty were not sufficiently strong, my
gratitude to my noble friend and protector would
prompt me so to act, and so to speak.</p>

<p>"Dion, we have been, though of hostile blood,
too much to each other during these terrible days to
doubt that we are led by the same hand of Providence.
I cannot see His will. I must not prejudge
it. I can only act upon each duty that I see, and
as I see it. But this much is plain to me&mdash;and you
will not mistake my meaning, good friend&mdash;I can
have no such interests as other women may feel while
my people are enslaved. To this I have vowed before
my nation's God. The redemption of Israel
from the hand of him whom you by your soldier's
oath have vowed to serve, that fills my heart. That
is my only sentiment; my only passion; but it is a
passion of fire. All else must burn away before
it."</p>

<p>"But," replied Dion, speaking very slowly, as if to
hear the echo of each word from the depth of her
heart before venturing another, and watching her
eyes for indication, as boys watch the ripples their
pebbles make when dropped into a well, "if&mdash;I&mdash;were&mdash;a&mdash;Jew
it might be otherwise? You could love me
if I were only a Jew? Deborah, I am a Jew in my
faith&mdash;since you have taught me that faith. I am a
soldier of fortune, and have sold my sword to the
lord of Antioch, but I would willingly give it to
your people, were it not that I foresee the hopeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>ness
of your cause. But with your love I could die
for Judaism."</p>

<p>"Noble Dion, these words are ill-considered. The
leopard cannot change his spots, as says our Scripture;
nor can a Greek become a Jew. And surely not
so light a thing as a passing fancy for a Jewish girl
should lead you to think to attain the impossible."</p>

<p>"But if&mdash;I&mdash;were a Jew?" queried he. "If you will
tell me that if Dion were a Jew you could love him,
that will be my happiness even as we part."</p>

<p>"If Dion were a Jew," replied Deborah, "he were
worthy of being brother to the sons of Mattathias,
and worthy the love of any woman." With which
words she ran from the room.</p>

<p>Captain Dion stood looking at&mdash;nothing, while the
sand ran half out of the glass.</p>

<p>"Am I a Jew or a Greek? I am surely a Jew inwardly,
and," glancing into a polished steel mirror,
"my nose is not, as I have often heard it said, as a
good Greek's should be, perfectly straight with my
forehead. By Jove! I could wish that a sabre cut
might bend it more. But, Greek though I am, my
sword and my wit are my own, and shall have but
one duty when Gorgias takes the city&mdash;to guard
this house and the woman who&mdash;would&mdash;love&mdash;me&mdash;if&mdash;I&mdash;were&mdash;a&mdash;Jew.
So much is clear, clear as the
Jew's law. Let me see if I can be a Jew. First 'to
do justly.' Yes, it will be only downright justice to
give my life for hers, since she has offered hers for
mine more than once. Secondly, 'to love mercy.'
Of course I do&mdash;in this case. Thirdly, 'to walk humbly
with my God.' Well, if I knew who God is, I
would. God of Jew or Greek teach me that!
Amen!"</p>

<span class="smaller">THE POISONER</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-d.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Deborah</span> retired to the roof of the house.
She gazed long to the west.</p>

<p>"Caleb, do you hear any sounds far
away?"</p>

<p>"None, but there is a great mist rolling
up from the Great Sea over Sharon, and up the
mountains toward our city. Now a wind from the
east rushes against the mist. I think it is a wind.
Can you see a wind, sister?"</p>

<p>"One can see the dust it drives."</p>

<p>"That's it; a little cloud of dusty wind. And it
drives away the mist. The mist rolls down the
long hills and away&mdash;away. Now it is lost in the
Sea. The dusty wind is Judas, I know."</p>

<p>A servant brought to Deborah a basket of fruit.
Ripened pomegranates glowed ruddy beside tawny
oranges in a bed of white blossoms which loaded the
air with delicious spicery. Cakes of figs compressed
with almonds were scattered through the tempting
heap.</p>

<p>Caleb caught the odor; his face became a resistless
appeal, which his sister answered by putting into
his hand the largest of the luscious fruits.</p>

<p>Deborah recalled the servant to ask the donor of
the fruit. Ephraim could not say, as it was brought
to him by one of the Greek guards in the court who
had taken it in at the gate. Deborah examined the
basket, and recognized the pattern of its inwoven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
withes as one that the Princess had taught Lydia,
the wife of Menelaos, and herself to make. She
quickly turned to Caleb.</p>

<p>"Do not eat, my child."</p>

<p>But the child had eaten. Almost immediately he
fell sick. His face became ashen pale.</p>

<p>Deborah carried the lad to his bed, and laid him
there. The physician Samuel was sent for in eager
haste; but that worthy man was beyond the city,
in the labor which absorbed him day and night, as
the case of no single patient could have done&mdash;the
critical condition of his nation. To whom could she
turn?</p>

<p>"Call Captain Dion," she bade Huldah.</p>

<p>A long time Dion watched the face and felt the
hands of the child.</p>

<p>"I know well these signs," he said. "And good
reason have I to remember them. When a lad I fell
sick very much as Caleb has done. The physician of
King Philip of Macedonia, at whose court I served
as page, declared my illness to be due to a peculiar
poison concocted by Alexandrian alchemists. For
weeks I lay, while the Fates' scissors fretted my life
thread. Again, when I was just a man, a similar
disorder came upon me. This time I was a soldier
in King Perseus' guard. But for the skill of a certain
physician, Theron, an adept in the arts of the
poisoner, and on that account retained in the King's
household, I had certainly perished. This second
secret attempt upon my life led Theron to counsel
me to forsake Macedonia. This I could not do. I
loved my King Perseus, and stood with him, until
some four years ago he was overthrown by the
Romans in that terrible fight at Pydna. But even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
in this remote region I seem to be pursued by the
poisoner, for I doubt not that this which Caleb has
taken was intended for myself, since it is known
that I am here."</p>

<p>"But," said Deborah, "this basket is like the
handiwork of the Princess."</p>

<p>"Of the Princess!" cried Dion, examining the basket.
"You are right; this is such work as one finds
in the bazaars at Antioch. Deborah, this was intended
for neither Caleb nor me, but for yourself."</p>

<p>He noted more closely the fruit. "These fruits are
not all such as grow in these lands. The figs and
almonds thus pressed together I have seen only in
the capital, and one place else&mdash;in the house of
Menelaos. It is a favorite with the Priest. Deborah,
I see through the damnable plot. Menelaos,
to accomplish his purpose on the property of Elkiah,
must leave no scion of the house alive. I swear that
this is that villainous Priest's design, executed too,
by a practised poisoner, and she&mdash;Heaven forbid
that I make a false charge!&mdash;she is none other than
the Princess. Before the sun sets I will probe the
secret with my knife, though it lies at the bottom
of this Priest's black heart."</p>

<p>"Give the child tepid water," he added. "Watch
him that he does not sleep; but that I think will
not be possible for some hours yet. The poison
rather stimulates wakefulness until the life is burned
out with its fires. I have at the Citadel some of the
medicine Theron bade me always keep with me."</p>

<p>As Dion left the apartment a great uproar rose in
the streets. Cries filled the air.</p>

<p>"The Jews have fled before Gorgias. They are
being driven into the city."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Jews are not fleeing, sister," said Caleb.
"They have been pursuing. I see a mighty eagle.
He has swirled above a flock of doves, but, quick as
the lightning flashes, a little bird has darted upon
him. He has mounted upon the eagle's back. His
beak is sharper than a sword, and cuts the eagle
through. The great bird falls. Surely the little bird
is Judas."</p>

<p>Whether Caleb's vision was the vagary of his fever-heated
brain, or a true prognostication from inner
sight granted him in compensation for his outer
blindness, one may not say, since we have not ourselves
passed through the borderland of the world
of sense.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Meph's</span> simile of the stratagem of the
little red ant which bites his antagonist
into two will give our club-footed
friend a place among the wisest
critics of military affairs; for this was
the plan of the battle of Emmaus as executed by
Judas.</p>

<p>The Greek armies gathered near Emmaus numbered
about fifty thousand men, under leaders who
were rendered expert by wars in many lands. The
Maccabæans had not more than one-tenth that
number. This little army was further reduced by
Judas' command dismissing all newly married men,
and all whose ripening crops might divide their attention
between peace and war, and all whose lack
of zeal made them hesitate or question the wisdom
of the call to battle. Not more than three thousand
bowed in prayer and consecration as the sun
went down on Mizpah.</p>

<p>When the night fell General Gorgias executed a
movement which would have increased his already
great fame as a strategist, had it not been countered
by an exploit of deeper subtlety and boldness on the
part of his antagonist.</p>

<p>The Greek General did not await the arrival of
his full army at Emmaus, but, making there a formidable
camp, well guarded by thousands of heavy-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>armed
troops, he pushed on with five thousand
horsemen and light-armed foot-soldiers to take the
Jews unawares in their camp at Mizpah. Under
the darkness of the night this advanced guard
stealthily and swiftly climbed the heights. Not a
solitary spot of the long crest was found sentinelled.
Surely the wily Maccabæan was caught sleeping.
Under order of perfect silence the Greeks glided on
toward Mizpah. So rapidly did the army pass that
even wild beasts were caught between the companies,
and prodded to death amid the feet of the
soldiers. On the assailants sped, that they might
come within striking distance of the Jewish camp
before daylight should reveal their approach. Thus
with one swoop in the first light of morning, Gorgias,
who was known as the "Hawk of Syria,"
would annihilate the whole brood of rebels.</p>

<p>At length dawn poured its ruddy lustre upon the
high hill of Mizpah. Rocks and thorny shrubs, here
a stunted juniper and there a pile of stone which
had been a camp kitchen, stood clear in the light,&mdash;but
not a Jewish tent or soldier was to be seen.</p>

<p>With rage and shame the outwitted Greek gave
orders for retreat to his own camp twenty miles
away. The chagrin of the leader became the disgust
of the soldiers as they retraced their steps
along the dusty road. Some, who would be wiser
than others, told of the probable flight of Judas
over the hills and beyond Jordan, scared by the
very number of so many valiant feet which would
have trampled his little host into the earth had he
awaited their coming. Gorgias professed his conviction
that the war was over, and that the Maccabæans
had disbanded. He talked aloud of turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
southward and resting his soldiers within the walls
of Jerusalem. But, mindful that he was dealing
with the strange man who had outgeneraled both
Apollonius and Seron, he deemed it more prudent
first to rejoin the armies of Ptolemy and Nicanor,
which he assumed were gathering about his camp
at Emmaus.</p>

<p>The day was well spent when, looking down
from the great ridge that might be called the Parapet
of Palestine, the Greek General saw in the distance
the smoke of his own burning camp; while
far away toward the fortress of Gezer in the northwest
two moving dust clouds indicated the position
of the Greeks pursued and of the Jews in hot
chase.</p>

<p>Judas had discovered Gorgias' movement toward
his camp at Mizpah as soon as it was begun.</p>

<p>With greater celerity than that of the Greek, he
abandoned his own stronghold, pushed his band
westward, slipped by his antagonist on a more
southerly road, and, in a line as straight as that
of a swarm of bees, and with as little sound in the
going, made for the camp of Gorgias at Emmaus.
Here was the slender waist of Meph's big ant, with
Gorgias' advance for its head, and the detachments
of Ptolemy and Nicanor for its legs.</p>

<p>The early dawn which had revealed to the Greek
the unoccupied Jewish camp at Mizpah, showed to
Judas a splendid canvas city near Emmaus; the
open plain bossed with tents of various colors,
gleaming with the polished paraphernalia of horses
and the burnished armor of still sleeping men. Here
were gathered, not only the stores of Gorgias' army
and those awaiting the great hosts of Ptolemy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Nicanor, still in the rear, but bales of woollen and
silken wares, boxes of jewels and bags of silver coin;
for in sure expectancy of victory the Greeks had allowed
to come with them a great number of merchants
who were to make Jerusalem a second Damascus
of trade, when it should be delivered from
the menace of the Jewish insurgents.</p>

<p>The first intimation the Greeks in this splendid
camp had of danger was the sound of the silver trumpets
of the Jews, which from the ancient days of
Israel had rung out the battle-call. The notes
floated through the chill morning air with little
more speed than Judas' men skimmed the ground
in their agile assault. The Greeks fell on every hand,
some with casque half on, and most having scarcely
grasped sword. The mass of them precipitately
fled. Judas had his men so well in hand, and such
was their zeal of patriotic devotion, that no man
thought of the wondrous opportunity for his own
enriching, but obeyed the command, "Be not greedy
of spoil, for there may still be battle betwixt us
and the night." The Jews pursued the fleeing
Greeks, until news that Gorgias was returning recalled
them.</p>

<p>Judas then so quickly and skilfully placed his men
about the unguarded camp at Emmaus that Gorgias,
deeming such an accomplishment the work
of an army many-fold that of the Jews, dared not
make attack. His men became panic-stricken, and
scattered in every direction, to gather only far
away to the west within the lines of Ptolemy and
Nicanor, and there to spread consternation by the
marvellous stories with which they accounted for
their defeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Judas assembled his fellow-religionists amid the
heaps of spoil. Before they laid hand to the reward
of their valor, they acknowledged the favor of Jehovah.
Then rang out the words of the old psalm,
"Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good.
His mercy endureth forever."</p>

<p>Laden with the fruits of victory, the patriot army
moved over the hills to their sacred city, and without
challenge from the foe, gathered before the
western gate.</p>

<p>As the soldiers deposited their burdens of spoil
they took their places in groups of tens and hundreds
according to the ancient arrangement of the
army of Israel&mdash;the order in which they had already
gone into the battle. The instant the morning
rays touched the Temple walls, the silver trumpets,
which yesterday had sounded the onset, gave
out the time notes of the antiphonal chant of Israel,
the Te Deum of victory during many ages of
faith:</p>

<p>"Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted
up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall
come in. Who is this King of Glory?</p>

<p>"The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory."</p>

<p>As the chant died away the great gate by the
tower of David was swung open. In the shadow
of the portal stood Deborah. She had arrayed herself
in richest apparel. Her chiton was of glistening
white silk and dropped to her feet. It was
girdled high beneath the breasts; opening deep
above, exposing a neck that needed no circlet to
adorn it. From her shoulders fell a purple robe.
This was matched by a purple cap that rose high
from her forehead and was banded with pearls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Strings of these gems were pendent against her
black hair, which, unclasped, fell about her shoulders.</p>

<p>This contrast with the remembrance of her in the
cheap attire of the Fort of the Rocks, and as with
bleeding feet she flitted over the stony fields on her
many secret missions, wrought the patriot soldiers
to the highest pitch of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"The Daughter of Jerusalem! the Daughter of Jerusalem!"
The shout was taken up by one company
after another. It echoed from the walls and floated
over the hills.</p>

<p>By Deborah's side was a Greek. He was in full
uniform of a Captain in the King's service. Judas
quickly confronted him. The contrast between the
two men was extreme. The Greek was the model for
an Apollo, such was his grace of pose and motion.
His muscles were full, yet long, exquisitely moulded
by the practice of the gymnasium and by the fencer's
art. The Jew was a Hercules of gigantic stature;
"badly put together," would have been the
comment of a gymnasiarch; long arms, legs short,
muscles knotted. The Greek was clean-shaven, his
locks oiled; the Jew's head covered with reddish
hair bleached by exposure. The Greek was handsome,
a woman's ideal. The Jew's face, overhung
by heavy brows, based in a broad, square chin, and
covered with short, untrimmed beard, might have
been an unpleasant one, but for the kindly brightness
of his eyes, which would have won the confidence
of a child.</p>

<p>The Greek made obeisance to the conqueror.</p>

<p>"Judas, son of Mattathias, I, though esteemed a
heathen, have made a vow before your God, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
if Jehovah granted you victory in this battle, I
would serve Him and you."</p>

<p>"I am not commissioned to receive the service of
any but the men of Israel," replied Judas firmly,
but with a courtesy that could awaken no resentment.</p>

<p>"Then know that Dion, son of General Agathocles
of Macedon, forswears the service of Antioch, and
vows loyalty only to the cause of the Jewish
people."</p>

<p>Judas glanced at Deborah. "Is this the friend of
the house of Elkiah? For thy sweet sake, daughter,
it shall be as he wills."</p>

<p>He grasped the hand of Dion.</p>

<p>While this scene was transpiring at the western
gate a very different one might have been witnessed
at the south gate. The street within was packed
with a motley multitude impeding one another's
way in their eagerness to escape from the city. Men
and women, rich and poor, young and old; some
bruising the backs of their neighbors with the chests
they carried upon their shoulders; others with their
palanquins forcing the crowd asunder, commanding,
entreating, shouting imprecations, and crying with
hurts, choked the gateway.</p>

<p>"Way! way for the High Priest!" sounded above
the din.</p>

<p>A giant Nubian with his gnarled arms threw
the people to right and left and opened a passage
for Menelaos and Lydia, whose blanched faces
peered out from the purple curtains of their vehicle.</p>

<p>Amid this scurrying crowd, amid tattered wealth
and paupers bedizened with their stolen finery,
went an exquisite carriage, in which, covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the robes at the feet of Clarissa, the harlot dancer
and poisoner of Antioch, crouched the form of Glaucon,
son of Elkiah.</p>

<p>Jonathan begged permission to dash upon the
fugitives and make an end of them, even as his
father had slain the renegade Jew at the gate of
Modin.</p>

<p>But Judas refused. "Let them depart. Let the
wound of Israel slough off its foulness; it will the
sooner heal."</p>

<span class="smaller">"A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM"</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-w2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> the overthrow of Gorgias became
known in the city, many of the soldiers
of Antiochus fled even more precipitately
than did the traitorous Jews.
The grim towers beat upon the fugitives
with shadows like the wings of an avenging
spirit, which, indeed, some declared they saw descend
from the sky. A few companies under Meton's closer
discipline kept within the Citadel. Even that
Commandant's courage had been well shaken by the
previous disaster to Seron, and his nerves permanently
disordered by the tragedy of the General's
suicide in his presence. The new discomfiture of the
more famous Gorgias&mdash;a defeat so thorough that
even that great soldier's genius seemed utterly paralyzed,
so that he did not attempt a retaliatory
blow&mdash;completed the demoralization of Meton, so
that he gave no orders for the defence of the city at
large, being fully content to keep his own skin unpunctured
within the walls of his castle. Judas,
having no artillery for assailing the fortifications
which had withstood every assault since the days of
Nebuchadnezzar, was equally content to let Meton
be his own jailer.</p>

<p>The house of Elkiah became the resting-place of the
Jewish hero on the few and brief occasions when he
rested anywhere. He was incessant in his watch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
For days he would be absent with his brothers
scouting the country to the eastward. He commissioned
the brightest men as messengers to the
tribes not yet allied with him, offering them either
peace or war as their Sheikhs might elect. Envoys
were sent to the Romans, to the Egyptians. He
laid out extensive plans for the restoration and fortification
of the city walls. In this he was aided by
Dion, who had already attained a certain celebrity as
an engineer among the Greeks.</p>

<p>For such projects there was urgent call, and for
all the resources of Judas' fertile brain. Lycias, the
new Governor of Syria, was collecting the remnants
of Gorgias' army, compacting them with those of
Nicanor and Ptolemy, and enlarging them by daily
arriving contingents sent from all parts of Antiochus'
kingdom. The Governor quickly marshalled
a force of sixty thousand, ready to renew the war.</p>

<p>Even these public and threatening affairs did not
entirely absorb the attention of Judas. When in
Jerusalem he came daily and watched the failing
life of the blind child. As the lad's body grew
emaciate the blind eyes gained in lustre, the light of
his soul flooding them from within, like stars bursting
through a fleecy cloud. Judas would sit by the
bedside of the sufferer, gazing upon the thinning
and whitening face, while his own thoughts were
far away among the problems of statecraft and
strategy.</p>

<p>"Yes," he one day said to Dion, "Caleb's eyes are
my oracles, as my father used to say Deborah's
were to him. They are to me what I imagine the
water of the deep springs is to your Greek priests.
In them I sometimes seem to see the lines of coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
battle, and the shadows of great events that heaven
is preparing to bring to pass."</p>

<p>At times Judas would throw himself upon the bed
beside his little friend, whose restlessness was calmed
when he could pass his tiny, shrunken fingers over
the face of the champion. Suddenly the soldier
would kiss the child's hot lips, and, without a word,
hasten away to the towers or the fields, as if
prompted by some inspiration.</p>

<p>One day the lad said to Judas:</p>

<p>"Big brother, carry me as you used to do in the
Fort of the Rocks."</p>

<p>"Where shall I take you, little brother?"</p>

<p>"Take me to the roof, that I may see the clouds
with your eyes&mdash;God's banners, father used to call
the clouds with their white and gold. And I would
see, too, the mountains full of the chariots and
horses of God; and hear the winds talk, and tell
their strange stories of what is happening everywhere
they go. Take me, big brother."</p>

<p>The lad lay in Judas' arms behind the parapet, his
fingers feebly twining in the thick beard of his giant
playmate. The wind came softly from the south.</p>

<p>"What was the wind saying to you, little
brother?"</p>

<p>"It comes from Bethlehem, that I know; and it
talks about Bethlehem."</p>

<p>"And what does it say about Bethlehem?"</p>

<p>"It says that you, Judas, were born in Bethlehem."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Why, it repeated the words of the prophet, 'And
thou, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, art not the
least among the princes of Judah, for out of thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
shall come a Governor that shall rule my people
Israel.'"</p>

<p>"Say not such things, my child," said Judas, "I
was born here in Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"Do you remember it?" said Caleb.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I think you are mistaken."</p>

<p>For a while they were both silent. Suddenly
Caleb cried:</p>

<p>"Look! Look, Judas! A star!"</p>

<p>"There are no stars now, little brother; it is daytime."</p>

<p>"A star! A star! There it floats over Moab.
Now it passes over Jordan. There! There! A star
out of Jacob, which Balaam saw."</p>

<p>The thin hands were stretched out, the eyes fixed,
the whole frame of the child shook with convulsion.</p>

<p>Judas gazed into Caleb's eyes&mdash;his fountain of
divination&mdash;but the depths were covered, as when a
spring is frozen over. Tears from his own eyes
dropped upon the face of the child, which gave back
no response. He pressed his lips against those of the
lad. Was it to breathe into them his own abundant
life? or to take from them the sweetness of the life
that was failing? Judas had been called to ponder
great problems, questions involving the fate of a
nation, the solution of which he believed to be the
fulfilment of prophecy and the turning of the highways
of history. But here was a deeper study than
statecraft or war&mdash;that of the issue of a child's
life. Whither was it going? On what wings would
the spirit rise as now it was disentangling itself
from the frail flesh which had held it down for a
little while? "What," he thought, "is love&mdash;the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
by which this little one has held my soul close to
his, calming my turbid nature, taming my ferocity,
and making me think of and feel the nearness of God
himself!"</p>

<p>A slight tremor ran through the tiny frame.
Judas carried Caleb within the upper chamber, and
laid him upon the couch. Then, burying his face in
the pillow, this strongest of men wept with a breaking
heart over a dead child.</p>

<p>Deborah quickly came, and Dion too; for the tidings
sped. As they gazed upon the beautiful face,
which seemed but the shadow of the soul that still
hovered over it, Judas repeated Caleb's last words,
about the star.</p>

<p>"It is prophecy," said Deborah. "What saith the
Scripture of these words of Balaam? 'He hath said
which heard the word of God, and knew the knowledge
of the Most High, which saw the vision of the
Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes
open,' even as Caleb did, 'I shall see Him soon, but
not now. I shall behold Him, but not nigh. There
shall come a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall
rise out of Israel.' Of whom are these things said,
son of Mattathias?"</p>

<p>"I know not, Deborah." For a long time Judas
sat with his head bowed upon his hands. Neither
spoke, but worshipped silently by the altar of their
grief. At length Judas said: "But I know that He
shall come. I too 'shall see Him, but not now. I
shall behold Him, but not nigh.' Of whom the
words are spoken God knows. It is enough for us
that we be found faithful."</p>

<p>Dion stood by. He looked from the champion to
the heroine as they spoke thus together. Then he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
too, kissed the dead child, and without a word
went away.</p>

<p>That day, as the sun was going down, a long procession
wound its way through the streets, and out
of the north gate to the rock-hewn tomb where lay
many generations of the house of Elkiah. There
they placed the body of the "little Prophet of
Israel," as the people fondly called him. As they
rolled the stone back in its groove, and thus covered
the mouth of the sepulchre, the multitude gazed
upon the giant form of their chieftain. But Judas
turned away, and laying his hand upon the shoulder
of Dion, as they walked together back to the city,
said:</p>

<p>"Captain Dion, have you anything in your Greek
books so beautiful as this from our prophet Esaias?
He is speaking of the days of Messiah, days to
come, when such peace shall fall upon the earth that
the 'wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the
leopard shall lie down with the kid&mdash;and a little
child shall lead them.'"</p>

<p>"In Messiah's days?" responded Dion. "It is already
fulfilled, for this little child has led us both;
both you and me."</p>

<h2>XLI<br />

<span class="smaller">A STRANGE VISITOR</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> were strange visitors in Jerusalem
during these days&mdash;Sheikhs from
beyond the Dead Sea, with turbans
as big as cartwheels, which might furnish
linen, if not enough for a tent to
live in, at least for one's winding-sheet when dead;
chiefs from beyond the Lebanons, with silken head-housing
of flaming colors, bound about the temples
with ropes of wool inwoven with silver and gold
threads; men wearing helms of leather, which capped
closely their thick, short hair, and having short
tunics bound about their loins with belts of hide
from which hung heavy half swords&mdash;these last
from the west, where Rome was challenging both
Alexandria and Antioch for the mastery of the world.
Such persons were drawn to Jerusalem by the fame
of Judas; for men wondered if a new star had appeared
which would change the shape of the constellation
of the nations.</p>

<p>Very different in bearing from these warlike and
courtly visitors were two persons who one day accompanied
Judas on the street, going toward the
house of Elkiah&mdash;a lame lad clattering on his crutch
and an old man tottering on his staff.</p>

<p>"I found him a day's journey&mdash;for a fox&mdash;to the
north&mdash;nigh on to Bethel," said Meph, his sentences
broken by the slipping of his crutch from project<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>ing
stones into mud-holes, of which things in about
equal proportion the pavement of the streets of Jerusalem
then consisted. "I treed him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Treed him? Our friend doesn't look like a climbing
animal," replied Judas, laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, I treed him; that is, I got him under a tree.
I knew that a man like him&mdash;would rest more than
he would walk&mdash;and&mdash;I believe&mdash;I got my eyes on
every tree big enough to cast shadow over a cony&mdash;between
here and Bethel before I spied him. I
thought he was dead&mdash;for he didn't hear me come,
and I make as much noise&mdash;Jonathan says&mdash;as a
broken-wheeled chariot. And he would have died&mdash;sure&mdash;but
for some of this stuff"&mdash;producing from
his jacket next the skin some fragments of black
bread. "But even then he couldn't talk until I had
given him&mdash;but, Judas, you won't put me under
arrest if I show you something?"</p>

<p>"No, Meph; you are not enrolled as a soldier, so
have a right to whatever you find."</p>

<p>"Then look at this!" said he, jerking from somewhere
under his shirt a flask of bluish bronze inlaid
with patterns of mother of pearl. "I found
this on the crest above Emmaus. Phew! Isn't it
fine? I'll wager you that General Gorgias himself
dropped that. Well, I knew there was something
good in it&mdash;so I just put it to the old man's mouth.
My! it oiled up his tongue so that he talked faster
than I can&mdash;on these stones. And he told me of
sailing on the sea&mdash;and riding camels on the desert&mdash;and
of beasts bigger than houses&mdash;with tails
on both ends&mdash;which trampled to death whole companies
of soldiers with a single step on them."</p>

<p>"Elephants," interjected Judas. "The old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
has travelled far if he has seen these monsters. They
say the King has sent some of them to Governor
Lycias for his next fight with us."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the boy. "Can I go and see
them?"</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Meph, "when the liquor had dried
out of his throat&mdash;the old man stopped&mdash;and I
couldn't get another word out of him except 'Dion!
Captain Dion!' I told him I knew a Captain Dion.
Then he got up and went with me&mdash;for about a furlong
when&mdash;he fell down&mdash;and so up and down&mdash;up
and down&mdash;we went all day&mdash;and all night, too&mdash;for
he wouldn't stop until he got here."</p>

<p>The old man was stumbling on with Judas' strong
arm beneath his shoulder, now and then putting
his hand to his ear, trying to catch what Meph was
saying.</p>

<p>A few moments later they were within the house.
The stranger was utterly exhausted, but, though
unable to rise from the couch upon which they had
laid him, his eyes were alert to everything. He
studied the furniture as if it had memories stored
in its carvings. The faces about him seemed to disappoint
him, but each swing of the curtain of the
chamber riveted his attention. He ate and drank
a little of what Deborah brought him; then fell
asleep, muttering in his dream:</p>

<p>"It's Dion I want. Don't take it, my child. Wait&mdash;wait;
I will find you. The sea is not wide enough
nor the mountains high enough&mdash;for Gideon ben Sirach
is strong yet."</p>

<p>Though broken, his sleep was long. The sun went
down, the night passed, and still he slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear he will not awake again," said Samuel,
the physician. "The breathing is heavy, and grows
shorter. His secret is his and God's."</p>

<p>"So let it be!" said Dion. "I don't know how it
can concern me. I do not care to know any mystery
that may have been over my past life, since
now I have come into a clearer light. I could well
wish that all the past were forgotten, and that life
could begin to-day."</p>

<p>"So it may, friend Dion," replied the physician.
"If God can forget anything, will not that make it
as if it had never been? Read our Scriptures. How
often the Lord says, 'I will not remember.' Where
go the clouds when the north wind blows upon
them? But saith the Lord, 'I will blot out as a
thick cloud thy transgression.'"</p>

<p>"It is a good word," said Dion. "I would trust
it. But see, our pilgrim stirs."</p>

<p>A slight tremor ran through the old man's frame.</p>

<p>"This is death!" whispered Samuel.</p>

<p>The physician's look, which had hitherto denoted
only anxiety for his patient's recovery, quickly
changed. It was now not less eager, but one merely
of curiosity. He held the patient's wrists, and
brought his face close for a study of death.</p>

<p>Though Samuel knew that the flight of a soul
cannot be followed, he gazed intently as if to detect
its direction in starting, or at least to note which
fibres of flesh longest retained their grasp of a departing
spirit.</p>

<p>But he was baffled. The sleeper suddenly threw
his arms above his head, hard knit his hands, then
drew in a deep breath and expelled it with a
groan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"No! He lives! The sleep has only refreshed
him!" cried Samuel.</p>

<p>"Has Gideon ben Sirach rested well?" he asked,
bending over him.</p>

<p>The man gazed stupidly at the physician, then
with a yawn fell asleep again.</p>

<p>"Well, let him rest, and when he wakes we will
have his story, if it takes some of the medicine from
Gorgias' flask to start it."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," said Dion, "his story will prove only
a dream that has oozed out from some crack in his
brain. We shall need one of your Josephs or Daniels
to interpret it."</p>

<p>"If it is so obscure as that we will summon
Meph," replied the physician. "That boy seems able
to solve riddles with a punch of his crutch."</p>

<h2>XLII<br />

<span class="smaller">A CLOSE CALL FOR DION</span></h2>
</div>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">"If</span> the Lord give me strength to end it,"
said Gideon ben Sirach the day following,
as he sat up on the edge of the
couch, and rested his hands on the top
of his staff. "If the Lord give me
strength, I will tell the tale&mdash;if such you may call
it&mdash;which has never yet passed my lips."</p>

<p>His black eyes, far sunken beneath his long and
bristling brows, gleamed sharply with the effort to
penetrate their partial blindness, and scan the faces
of his auditors.</p>

<p>"As the Lord liveth! I may trust my words in
your ears, Judas, son of Mattathias, whose father
has a score of times taken from my hands the
Passover Lamb, and slain it for the feast in my
master's house. And in whom can I confide if not
in the daughter of Elkiah, the just man, Nasi of our
Sanhedrin in days when not even the gold of Egypt
or Syria could bribe it to wrong judgment? And if
this man be not Dion, page of King Philip of Macedon,
and Captain in the army of his son Perseus,
may my words be deafness evermore in his ears if he
listens to them."</p>

<p>"Amen!" responded Dion. "I am your man so
far."</p>

<p>"Aye, and let thy Amen be the anathema of an
old man whose eyes in Sheol may soon look upon
the face of my master, to whom and to God I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
to render my account. My son, put thy hand beneath
my thigh, and swear that thou art he."</p>

<p>Dion obeyed. As he did so Gideon put his hand
upon the young man's brow, and pushed back the
thick curling locks. He felt with his long thin
fingers beneath the hair; then suddenly cried, with
excitement that barely allowed distinct utterance:</p>

<p>"Thou art Dion, but not the Greek."</p>

<p>"I am Greek for as many generations as thou art
Jew," replied Dion, laughing. "I swear, old man,
that I am a Greek."</p>

<p>"The Lord forgive your oath!" replied Sirach.
"But what was I saying? Had I told my tale?"</p>

<p>"No, good man, you had not yet begun it. We
are waiting to hear it and to believe it, if it be not
too incredible, for your memory seems as tangled as
your tongue."</p>

<p>"Aye, and believe it you shall. There was once in
Alexandria, in the days of Ptolemy called Euergetes&mdash;that
damnable king who bade them gather all the
Jews in the hippodrome that they might be trampled
to death by the feet of his elephants&mdash;there was
among these sons of Abraham one named Nahum,
son of Nahum of Jerusalem. By a miracle from the
hand of the Lord the infuriated beasts were tamed
and harmed not one of our people, even as the lions
in the presence of Daniel."</p>

<p>"We have heard the story," said Dion, impatient
at the old man's prolixity.</p>

<p>"Nahum escaped death; but, having been a leader
of our people against the tyrant, Ptolemy followed
him and his children with persecution. He seized the
estates, and sought to kill all his lineage. Nahum
fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sara, daughter of Nahum, was befriended by a
noble Greek of Macedon, who took her as a child to
his own house. She grew fairer than the flower of
the lotus, her mind brilliant as the diamond, her
virtue white as the pearl. By most she came to be
esteemed a Greek, for her father's friend bestowed
upon her all the culture of his people. But the God
of Isaac and Rebecca, of Jacob and Rachel, was
with her. There came to Alexandria a son of the
faith, as Isaac the patriarch came to Padan Aram.
My master, Shattuck, espoused this woman, Sara.
She bore him a son. But upon the child's face the
father never looked. Journeying to Alexandria
Shattuck was lost, whether by the hand of the robbers
of the desert, or through the jealousy of others,
I may not say&mdash;for I am too old a man to speak the
thoughts which it were well to bury with my body.
The child's life was sought, I know not by whom;
but this," Gideon bared his arm, across which was
the scar of a wound that had well-nigh severed it
near the shoulder, "this arm took part of the stroke
which, but for it, would have exterminated my
master's house."</p>

<p>Dion had been listening not only with incredulity,
but with some disposition to make sport of Sirach's
story. He now took the hand of the old man, and
gazed upon the scar as if it were an object of religious
reverence. He then pushed his fingers through
his own hair in a manner that was not his habit
even when deeply thinking.</p>

<p>"Old man," said he, "if I were the baby for whom
you took that slash, I would build you a tomb as
big as Absalom's down there in Siloa. That cut
would have taken the top off a man's head."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>Sirach continued: "These arms carried the boy to
the house of the noble Greek, always the friend of
Nahum's daughter. This man suddenly disappeared
from Alexandria, taking with him Sara and her
child. I learned that they went into Macedonia;
and that he might shield the repute of Sara he
claimed her as his wife and the lad as his own son.
Meanwhile I was in charge of the wealth of Shattuck
my master.</p>

<p>"The property of my master in Alexandria was
of great value. For many years&mdash;God is my witness&mdash;Gideon
ben Sirach has guarded it. Not a shekel
of it all has passed to others. Faithful men of
our race have stood with me against those, high
in the King's favor, who would have taken it. So
long as the death of the child cannot be proved the
estate remains. His death established, all will be
alienated to the state, which in Alexandria means
to those whose favor the King buys by granting
them the liberty to rob whom they will.</p>

<p>"The child of Sara I have searched for far and
wide. While the Greek lived he could not be induced
to confess that he was not the lad's father. His
pride and contumely for our race&mdash;no, I will not
say such words&mdash;his love for the boy forbade it.</p>

<p>"When the noble Greek died a few years later,
the child disappeared. I traced him to the court of
Philip, where he was in waiting, and afterward,
as he grew to be a man, to the camps of Perseus,
and at last into the service of Antiochus. Wherever
the armies of Syria have gone Gideon ben Sirach
has followed, but with too slow a foot. When this
new Antiochus&mdash;the Lord rot his bones!&mdash;poured his
legions into our Holy Land, I pursued. But, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Jew, I have been expelled from his camps&mdash;until
now&mdash;the Lord's name be praised! My eyes behold
the son of Shattuck."</p>

<p>Sirach reached his hands toward Dion to embrace
him. The young man recoiled as if from defilement.</p>

<p>"Sirach is demented! Ha! ha! Dion a Jew! Dion
ben Shattuck! Oho! But take no offence, friend,
at my words. I have no doubt that Shattuck was
more worthy of my paternity than I am of inheriting
his shekels. But the whole thing is a dream of
Sirach. His memory is as confused as his tracks
have been while searching for his Dion. That I
may have been taken for such a waif is quite possible,
since I have been a homeless fellow&mdash;just the
one to gather myths, as the crooked oak on Olivet
draws flocks of wild pigeons to its dead boughs.
But there is nothing in it. I am not your Dion,
my good man, for all I like your story."</p>

<p>"Thou art not Dion? True, true," said Sirach,
"thou art not Dion, because thou art Gershom; for
so Sara, thy mother, called thee; for she said, 'He
is a stranger amid a strange people,' as thy name
Gershom signifies."</p>

<p>"Is there such a name among the Jews?" asked
Dion. "I have never heard it. But what sign, Sirach,
have you? I surely was never circumcised."
He burst into laughter.</p>

<p>"Sign? Sign?" cried Sirach. "By the scar on thy
forehead which my fingers felt when thou knelt, I
know thee."</p>

<p>Dion was for the instant startled, and felt again
amid his curled locks. At length he burst again into
loud laughter.</p>

<p>"I have now the clew of Sirach's credulity. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
child I was known for my crown jewel, as my playmates
called the scar on my head. As a page they
dubbed me 'Prince' because of it, and now my cock's
comb of a scar has been good Sirach's decoy. Ha!
ha! I bethink me there was a fellow in Philippi, a
Jew adopted by a Greek, who wore a split scalp.
I got my decoration in this way. As a child I
played with my father's great sword. One day it
fell on me, and but for the hand of some god as
helpful as the arm of Sirach to his little Gershom,
I had never lived to become the hero of such a
pretty tale as our friend has told. But now, Sirach,
I will give you a challenge in turn&mdash;tell me the
name of the good Greek who so befriended your
little Gershom's grandfather, Nahum, in the hippodrome."</p>

<p>Sirach sat staring at Dion, as if his words had
stunned him.</p>

<p>"Tell us the noble Greek's name, Sirach&mdash;the Greek
who was Sara's father's friend."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the old man, "Nahum's friend
was Ctesiphon, Ctesiphon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;I am the son of Agathocles," fairly shouted
Dion. "I am not son of any Ctesiphon."</p>

<p>The old man rose. He attempted to speak, but
his throat gave no utterance. His face twitched as
if pulled by strings. He sank back upon the couch.
His eyes followed Dion; otherwise he was motionless.</p>

<p>"He would tell us more," said the Greek, and
bent above him, held by a strange fascination. But
the lips did not move again. An intense longing
came into his eyes, as if the soul would speak without
need of voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a stroke of God," said Samuel. "He will
tell us no more. I surely thought he had you, Dion,
for as good a Jew as the rest of us."</p>

<p>"But for my father, Agathocles', memory I had
not cared," replied Dion. "If my sword be Jew,
why not the hand that holds it?"</p>

<p>"I will send my servants," said the physician,
"and have Gideon removed. He is taken in dumb
palsy, a disorder I would study. In my house he
shall have comfort while life abides in his frame,
which will not be long; although I have known
such to live for many moons."</p>

<p>"He shall remain here," commanded Deborah.
"He is a true Jew, servant to my father's friend."</p>

<h2>XLIII<br />

<span class="smaller">BATTLE OF BETHZUR</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-l.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Little</span> thought was given to Sirach or
his story during the next few weeks.
The nation was summoned to a sudden
life-and-death-struggle with the Syrian
Empire. Lycias, the Governor, menaced
the Sacred City with sixty thousand men.
Profiting by the failure of his predecessors in the
three "Battles of the Passes"&mdash;the Wady on the
north, the Heights of Bethhoron, and the slopes of
Emmaus on the west&mdash;this cautious General passed
to the south, and then swung his armies eastward
to the neighborhood of Hebron. It was a masterful
stroke, since from that region there were many
roads which converged to a point not far from the
city. Upon any one of these open ways the invaders
might mass, or with their greater numbers they
might advance in force by all of them. The choice of
approach being with the invaders, the defender was
forced to abide an attack very near the city walls,
unless by strategic insight he could divine his antagonist's
plan almost before he began to execute it.
Judas was therefore compelled to sentinel every spot
of ground from Bethshemesh on the west to Hebron
on the south. His sharp-eyed peasant soldiers signalled
by flying arrows in the day and fire-flashes at
night the slightest change in the disposition of the
Greek forces. The instant Lycias' advance turned
into the open valley of Elah, and began its wary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
movement northward, the Jewish leader saw that
the enemy would essay the narrow pass between the
rocky slope of Bethzur and the cliff of Halhul, some
twelve miles from the city. He therefore gathered
his men secretly a little north of that gateway of the
hills and waited. Judas was mindful that these
slopes and wadies through which the Greek legions
would have to approach were memorials of the
valor of David, the shepherd king of Judah, in his
wars against the Philistines. He bade his men bow
for worship, and himself led the prayer:</p>

<p>"Blessed art Thou, O Saviour of Israel, who didst
break the violence of the mighty by the hand of Thy
servant David, and didst deliver up the camp of the
stranger into the hands of Prince Jonathan. Shut
up now this army of the invaders in the hands of
this Thy people Israel, and let them be confounded
in all their host."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the muttered "Amens" ceased when
the clatter of horsemen was heard beyond the pass.</p>

<p>The Greeks were not aware of the presence of the
Jews, since the latest of their scout reports placed
the patriots in unsuspicious ease behind their city
walls. They, therefore, moved incautiously into the
narrow valley of Bethzur.</p>

<p>Judas silently watched until their masses and armaments
were at the point where the hills gave them
least freedom of movement, then his signal poured suddenly
the entire patriot army upon the advancing
foe. They struck the Greek column in front. When
Lycias had succeeded in deploying to meet the attack
from that direction, his agile assailants slipped
to either side, and, scaling the hills, descended upon
him as a flood makes every depression its channel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Everywhere the Jews had advantage of higher
ground, each cubit of which was familiar to them.
They knew the outlet of every pathway, as deer
know their runways to water. Their captains had
marked the rocks which companies of tens or threes
could use as breastworks. They had gauged the
distance for arrow or spear or slingstone between
these natural forts and the open spaces the foe
must cross, so that their aim was unerring. The
Greeks, attempting to turn from the threatened impact
in front, were met at disadvantage by half-concealed
Maccabæans, whose deadly shots slaughtered
them before they could locate the source of
attack. Upon the hastily formed roofs of linked
shields, the noted phalanx of the Greek, the Jews
hurled great boulders, crashing through brass and
bone. The air was darkened with flying missiles,
which dropped like a storm of hail upon those in
that open valley.</p>

<p>The cry "Mi-camo-ca-ba" echoed seemingly from
the very sky. In their blind rage to open ways of
reaching the enemy or of flight, the Greeks assailed
one another, as the scorpion stings itself to death.
Before nightfall the army of Lycias was shattered
beneath the strokes of the Hammer of Israel.</p>

<p>Just previous to the battle Dion had asked permission
to join in the fray. Judas replied:</p>

<p>"I have no orders except for my own and kindred
people. The victory will be of the Lord, and that
He will give only to the children of the faith." He
put his hand familiarly upon Dion's arm, as he
added: "Had old Gideon ben Sirach's tale ended
differently, as I had hoped, I would have given you
command of a thousand men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>To this Dion responded with somewhat of resentment:
"Is not your faith, Maccabæan, mine? Do
you distrust my word of honor, which I gave you
at the gate? I beg that you let me prove my sincerity
in the sight of our two nations."</p>

<p>"I may give you no charge," replied Judas, "but
I take it that before another sunset one who would
fight for Jewry will find his own opportunity. And
I pledge you, Dion, not to forget your service,
though I may not direct it."</p>

<p>"It is enough," rejoined the Captain, as he hastened
toward the battle, divining at a glance where
it would be thickest.</p>

<p>No spot in all the bloody field was more hotly
contested than a little green glade about a spring.
Jew and Greek fought desperately for possession of
its cooling waters. The holders of the ground at
one moment were slaughtered at the next by new
assailants. More than a score of times the spring
alternated its owners. Its veins seemed to spurt
out blood, so thickened had the water become.</p>

<p>At this spot toward the close of the day two men
glared at each other over their sword points. One
was Dion; the other wore the badge of high honor
among Lycias' officers. He was faint from long
exertion; but even Dion, master of sword-play
though he was, could not find a spot in his antagonist's
body unguarded by his quick ward. It was
evident, however, that Dion would soon get from his
foe's exhaustion what he could not wrest by his skill.</p>

<p>"Yield!" he cried.</p>

<p>The man slightly lowered his sword.</p>

<p>"That voice is not a Jew's," came from the Greek
helmet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>"The sword is," was Dion's reply.</p>

<p>"Yet played as never was a Jew's," came the response
between wards and panting breaths. "If I
am to fall, thank the gods it is by a Greek's hand,
though he be a traitor to his blood!"</p>

<p>"Traitor!"</p>

<p>The taunt fired all the fiend in Dion's soul. With
one stroke he sent his opponent's sword ringing
among the stones, and his body backward to the
ground, while a tremendous blow on his head completed
his discomfiture.</p>

<p>The displaced helmet revealed white hair and
beard. Dion did not strike again.</p>

<p>"I will not take the life of one of your years.
So valiant an arm must have done better service
than this in which it is now engaged. Rise! You
are my prisoner."</p>

<p>"I will not be prisoner to a Jew," said the prostrate
man. "But I swear by all the gods, that
stroke was of no Jew's arm."</p>

<p>"Taunt me not again," shouted the victor, "or,
by Jove! the sword, be it Jew or Greek, will find
your heart."</p>

<p>"'By Jove!' Why, man, you have not been Jew
long enough to learn new oaths. Now strike if you
will. My life is yours, but first"&mdash;the man assumed
an utter indifference of tone and manner&mdash;"first I
would have a drink of the spring. It is hard to
let out one's last breath through a throat so
parched."</p>

<p>"That boon is well earned," said Dion, his rage
tempered instantly by the man's grim humor.</p>

<p>He helped unclasp his antagonist's helmet, and
gave his hand as he tottered over the dead bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
which lay in heaps about the spring, and through
the mud made by the many feet that all day had
trampled the ground soaked with water and blood.</p>

<p>"Faugh!" said the man. "I cannot drink this
stuff. It is not wise to mix wines, and mixed bloods
are worse. Cut my veins, my friend, and let me
drink something at least clean and pure. A draught
of life&mdash;good Greek life&mdash;to die by&mdash;ha! ha! Help
me, ghost of Socrates!"</p>

<p>Dion cleared the surface of the fountain on the
side where it came trickling up from the earth and
mingled its white beads with the red foulness. Using
his helmet for a vessel, he dipped a quantity.</p>

<p>"I have seen a fairer goblet at a feast," said he,
offering it with a courtesy that was real for all its
seeming mockery.</p>

<p>"Which again proves that you are a Greek," was
the stranger's response.</p>

<p>"Why repeat that?" said Dion.</p>

<p>"Because," said the old man, "it is true. Would
you know how I detected it?"</p>

<p>The two became interested in each other's faces.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Dion.</p>

<p>"Why, as I said, I knew you by your sword play.
And not only are you a Greek, but I swear you are
a Greek of Macedonia. Do I not know it? Never
before was my sword tricked out of my hand either
in play or fight. No man could have done that,
had he the strength of Heracles, but in one way&mdash;and
that way you learned in the school of Philippi."</p>

<p>"The Jews travel far. They learn what pleases
them," said Dion, with suppressed amazement.</p>

<p>"But no Jew ever learned that guard and thrust
in one movement." The stranger imitated the mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>tion
with his hand. "It was my own invention."</p>

<p>"You!" gasped Dion in amazement. "You! If
you take that man's name falsely, you die like a
dog! Who are you?"</p>

<p>The officer sprang to his feet. He put his hands
upon the young man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Gods! Can this be?"</p>

<p>A swirl in the battle-tide brought others to the
spring. Dion and the stranger moved away. They
were closely watched by a party of Jews, some of
whom were ordered to keep them under constant
surveillance.</p>

<p>"It is that Greek," said their officer. "See, he is
in communion with the enemy. Take them alive,
but if they try to escape kill them both."</p>

<p>The two turned from the open glade to a covert
among the rocks. Scarcely had they begun to converse
when they were seized by overpowering numbers,
who could not have more stealthily performed
the exploit if they had been leaves of the overhanging
trees which turned into men as they fell. The
arms of the captives were quickly pinioned behind
their backs, and under guard they were marched to
the city.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> following day the excitement in Jerusalem
was intense and clamorous.
As band after band of the Jewish heroes
returned from the pursuit of the
Greeks they were met at the city walls
with such cheers that the Kedron valley echoed as
if the generations of the dead entombed along its
rocky sides had awakened to greet the valor of the
living. Companies vied with one another in relating
the marvels of prowess they had performed;
but through all the boasting ran a vein of reverent
recognition of the heavenly leading of affairs, and
almost as worshipful praise of the strange man by
whose hand Jehovah had wrought this new deliverance.</p>

<p>Those who had captured Dion at the spring of
Bethzur gave full credit to their own shrewdness
and courage in that exploit.</p>

<p>"All Greeks are treacherous," was one comment.
"Judas is so true himself that he suspects no one
else; but he ought not to have allowed the Macedonian
to remain in the city after the rest of his
kind had been chased out by their own heels."</p>

<p>"Think of his impudence! He even asked for a
command. To command us&mdash;us! Jonathan was
for trusting him; but Simon, the Wise, advised caution.
No doubt this Greek traitor had planned an
ambush for us. The other Greek is of high rank;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
his face would show that without the gold in his
sword-hilt."</p>

<p>"But Captain Dion fought splendidly," interjected
another. "I myself saw him make five Greeks bite
the dust."</p>

<p>"That is true," observed one, "and but for his
advice at one time it might have gone hard with
my company. We were wedged in between the hills,
and the Greeks were about to link shields&mdash;and when
they do that they will move through the gate of
hell&mdash;but Captain Dion gave me the hint, and himself
posted us so that we took them on the flank, and
buried them under their own metal. But, as I have
thought of it since, I remember that I didn't move
our men exactly as Dion advised me, or we might
have come out right in front of the phalanx and
been trampled to pieces. It must have been a trick
on the part of the traitor."</p>

<p>"No doubt," was the response. "The Greek has
been playing us false throughout; but his toes are
in the trap now."</p>

<p>This popular estimate of Dion was repeated in
higher places.</p>

<p>Judas took no part, except as a listener, in the
council of his brethren as they debated the matter.</p>

<p>Simon repeated his former warnings, which now
seemed justified. Eliezar recalled several other instances
in which Dion's actions might have had
a sinister intent. John attributed to him some
secret advice which he must have sent to Lycias,
and which led the Greek General to make the assault
upon Jerusalem from the south, the only direction
in which Judas had looked with any fear. That
plan was shrewdly laid, and but for the swiftness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
with which Judas made his counter plan, and the
rapid succession of his blows upon the enemy before
they got through the hills of Bethzur, the Greeks
had surely taken the city.</p>

<p>These insinuations brought to the face of Judas
no sign of his being influenced by them; but a certain
word that fell from Jonathan was met by a
quick flash in the champion's eyes.</p>

<p>"If Captain Dion proved treacherous, perhaps the
daughter of Elkiah can explain it. She could have
made the Greek a Jew with a breath."</p>

<p>Jonathan touched Simon's hand as he said this.
Judas mused a moment, his face reddening as it did
only under deep emotion, generally of some resentment.
His response was laconic:</p>

<p>"The Greek shall have justice."</p>

<p>"Justice should not go with lagging feet," said
Simon.</p>

<p>"Nor leap," replied the chieftain. "Only God can
give judgment with lightning."</p>

<p>"True, but men should be quick to see a storm
coming, my brother," said Simon. "Let the men be
summoned at once. There may be other treasons
for aught we know. We have caught but two serpents
in the nest. If others are there we will start
them to squirming. I will have the prisoners
brought."</p>

<p>"Let them wait," was Judas' decision.</p>

<p>"Wherefore wait, my brother? We can discover
who and what these men are very quickly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Judas; "but it may take time to
know ourselves."</p>

<p>"Going into one of his moods again," remarked
Eliezar, and the brethren went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>The two prisoners were generally forgotten in the
popular excitement of a few days immediately following
the victory of Bethzur. Mountains of spoil
had been brought into the city and distributed&mdash;for
Judas insisted that his men should share equally the
fruits of their bravery. Bethzur was fortified against
the possible return of Lycias, who raged in his disgrace
like a wounded tiger. Even if he should not
repeat his venture, the nomadic people to the south
were making hostile demonstration; indeed, all the
tribesmen, south, east, and north were in commotion.
Yusef, the Arab, had stirred up all tentdom to
avenge the insult which Nadan had reported, and
even the defeat of Lycias did not altogether discourage
the purpose which the coming of that
General had led them to make.</p>

<p>Said Yusef one day, watching a fight of insects:</p>

<p>"Let the Greeks bite the Maccabæans; we will
come later and be the sting."</p>

<p>The black tents of the Bedouins were again seen on
all sides, like mildew on a fair fabric. Couriers with
long lances and head cloths streaming in the wind
circled about Jerusalem at a safe distance, as Meph
sagely remarked, "Like a lot of spiders webbing in a
big bug they dare not yet attack."</p>

<p>These things would have sufficiently engaged the
time of the Maccabæan leaders had not very different
matters also claimed their attention. The far-flashing
fame of Judas startled the nations. Envoys
from various kingdoms came to Jerusalem to study
the meaning of the new power, which seemed to
rise as mysteriously as the armed men who sprang
from the ground sown with the fabled dragon's
teeth. The Governor of Ph&oelig;nicia and C&oelig;le-Syria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
proposed terms of alliance with Judas. Demetrius,
a nephew of King Antiochus, an aspirant for the
succession to the Syrian throne, now a hostage in
Rome, sent secret emissaries pledging the independence
of Palestine as the price of Judas' assistance in
accomplishing his ambition. From Athens, on the
other hand, came those who would bribe this new
sword for the help of Greece against the Romans.
These, again, were met on their way by the agents
of Rome, who were also coming to offer rank and
power to the new kingdom of Israel as a province
of the great republic of the West.</p>

<p>Judas and his counsellors had thus to consider
many wider problems than that of man&oelig;uvring an
army. It was clear that Jerusalem was to become
again a capital, and the scattered people a nation.</p>

<p>"Judas must be our King," said Jonathan.</p>

<p>To this all agreed, with a solitary exception.
Judas indignantly replied:</p>

<p>"I am but as the hand of a Gideon; would you
have me play the part of Abimelech? A bramble
king, indeed, would you find me. I am fit only to
be a scourge to the enemies of the Lord. Let me be
but as a soul within a sword until the Lord sheathes
me, as I know He soon will. Are we not near the
time of the coming of Him who is promised as
the Prince of Peace? Search the records, Simon; the
books of the prophets, and the genealogies of families
of Judah, for Messiah is to be a branch of
David&mdash;that surely is not of the house of Mattathias."</p>

<p>Jonathan replied:</p>

<p>"The words of the Prophets are hard to interpret,
my brother, while the events of Providence lie open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
like these hills in the sunshine. Only the blind fail
to see the signs of the times. Woe to the man among
us who cannot recognize the trumpet call of the
Lord, when every blast of it has already destroyed
an army of the enemy, as the rams' horns made the
walls of Jericho fall down. Least of all should
Judas shut his eyes to the light because it happens
to fall in front of his own feet."</p>

<p>When Judas was not present his brethren spoke
together freely, assuming the kingship to be inevitable.
They concerned themselves only with schemes
for founding and strengthening the new monarchy.</p>

<p>"Judas must marry," said Simon. "The nation
can be built upon no one man."</p>

<p>"Surely not upon a single man like Judas," replied
Jonathan, "whose life must be in perpetual hazard
of battle; for well I see that war will be our condition
for many years to come. The little land of
Judea is not wide enough for a kingdom. We must
conquer all the ancient lands of our fathers."</p>

<p>"And Syria, Ph&oelig;nicia, C&oelig;le-Syria also," rejoined
Simon, "until Solomon's empire, 'from the river to
the end of the earth,' from the Euphrates to the
Great Sea, shall have been restored. Judas must
found a family to whom this work shall be committed."</p>

<p>"It will be possible to make alliance by marriage
with one of the great powers," suggested Jonathan.
"I would not despair of a princess of Egypt
even."</p>

<p>"It were a sin to think of such a thing," replied
Simon, indignantly. "Did not the Lord rebuke Solomon
for his foreign wives? The men who sit upon
the Maccabæan throne must be of blood as pure as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
that of Judas himself, untainted, as we know, in a
thousand years. There is but one woman for Queen
of Jerusalem, the daughter of Elkiah. The glory of
the High Priests' house has departed. What house
comes next? Is it not that of the last Nasi, Elkiah
the martyr? Besides, Judas has already set his heart
upon the maiden."</p>

<p>"She will never be the wife of Judas," said Jonathan.</p>

<p>"Deborah not the wife of Judas? What woman in
Jewry would refuse such honor?"</p>

<p>"One woman."</p>

<p>"To utter such suspicion is treason," cried Simon,
in a towering rage.</p>

<p>"Not to speak as one sees would be treason far
worse."</p>

<p>"And you have seen&mdash;what?" cried both Simon
and Eliezar.</p>

<p>"I have seen&mdash;well, I have seen a cat play with a
dog, and both forget that they were made to tear
each other."</p>

<p>"This is no matter for mirth, nor for silly parables,
in which Jonathan is given to hiding his
thoughts. What have you seen?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, I have seen a Jewess and a Greek.
Ask me no more," and Jonathan turned away.</p>

<p>For a while neither of the remaining men spoke.
At length Simon said:</p>

<p>"Do you believe this?"</p>

<p>"I have heard it on the street," replied Eliezar.
"And it is said that, since the taking of that Dion
in the very act of treachery, Deborah has not been
beyond her house. She certainly has had no part
in any public rejoicing over our great victory. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
a scrap of color has been hung from her parapet."</p>

<p>"Does Judas suspect such a thing?"</p>

<p>"He has not been within the house of Elkiah since
the battle. And that is strange. He was always
there."</p>

<p>"It is well," added Simon, "that the Greek must
die. Whatever favor the daughter of Elkiah has
shown him, the clear evidence we have of his villainy
will open her eyes. But Jonathan's thought
is beyond credulity. It is a trick of him they well
call the Wily. Jonathan is bent upon our making
alliance with the heathen, and would divert us from
the course which patriotism and religion demand;
aye, and that which Judas' own inclination would
favor. Did you not notice his manner when Jonathan
mentioned the name of the Greek in connection
with Deborah? I tell you, Judas will make a quick
end of this proselyte when he learns what men are
saying of the traitor's friendship for the maiden."</p>

<p>"And I shall see to it that he hears it," replied
Eliezar.</p>

<h2>XLV<br />

<span class="smaller">THE TRIAL</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> morning after this conversation the
two prisoners were summoned. The
court was held in the open portico of
the gymnasium on Ophel. Captain
Dion and his companion were brought
there, their arms still bound. Judas had been pacing
the portico, absorbed with his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"The prisoners, sir," said their custodian.</p>

<p>Judas sat down upon a fallen statue of Hermes,
near it a rusted discus. Slowly he raised his head, as
if loath to so much as look upon one taken in such
shame as that of Captain Dion. He glanced first into
the face of the older prisoner. In spite of his unkempt
condition this man was imposing. His erect attitude
belied his wrinkles as a token of age. The blood
from an undressed wound still clotted his brow, but
this could not hide the rare nobility of his features.</p>

<p>Judas studied the man a long time in silence. He
seemed fascinated by the stranger's appearance. If
what the Greek orators had on this very spot declaimed
were true, that a goodly physical endowment
is the outweaving of goodness of soul, Judas'
decision had been an instant discharge of the prisoner.</p>

<p>He turned to Dion. Before his eyes rested upon
the Captain, Judas forced a look of severity, knitting
his features into hardness. As when a soldier
puts a chain corselet over his breast, so Judas had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
evidently determined to guard his sense of strict and
merciless justice against any temptation that might
come from his former liking for the culprit. The
muscles of his face were set like linked steel.</p>

<p>Captain Dion returned his judge's gaze with perfect
self-possession. There was neither blush nor
pallor, nor flicker of fear, nor sign of resentment.</p>

<p>"Take off those ropes," commanded Judas. Then,
turning to a soldier:</p>

<p>"Your report, Captain Jacob!"</p>

<p>Captain Jacob related the events attending the
capture, as he himself, in charge of the company that
made the arrest, had witnessed them. He stated
that Dion and his accomplice were caught in apparent
hiding, engaged in conversation which betokened
familiarity and mutual understanding. Several
others confirmed Captain Jacob's evidence, and
added details which deepened the color in the picture
of the plotters, and, at the same time, brought
out the shrewdness and courage of their captors.</p>

<p>The clouds massed more heavily on Judas' brow
as he listened. There were moments with this
strange man when, without uttering a word, his
aspect became almost as terrible as when shouting
his battle-cry, "Mi-camo-ca-ba!" At such times his
friends would turn away, dreading the outburst
when the hot lava of his soul should reach his lips.</p>

<p>When the testimony against the prisoner was ended,
Judas remained for a long time silent. At length
he spoke. The words came slowly, as if each were
compelled to halt and answer the challenge of a
sentinel placed before the door of his lips.</p>

<p>"Has Captain Dion any explanation of what is
charged against him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Dion's coolness matched that of his interrogator.
There was neither stoical bravado nor shame in his
confession:</p>

<p>"Maccabæus, every word these men have spoken
is true."</p>

<p>A murmur of rage at the prisoner's audacity ran
through the crowd, as they pressed close about him.</p>

<p>"Is not this enough?" cried Simon, putting his
hand to his sword as if he himself would serve as
executioner on the spot.</p>

<p>Judas raised his hand. The angry multitude
moved back, yet every man stood ready to be the
minister of Judas' vengeance the moment the signal
should be given.</p>

<p>"Captain Dion," said the judge, "I did not ask
you to either confirm or deny what these true men
of Israel have said. Your confirmation would not
add a feather's weight to their veracity, nor would
the denial of ten thousand Greeks shake our confidence
in them. I ask not your testimony, but your
explanation."</p>

<p>"We need no explanation," muttered Eliezar.</p>

<p>"Let him explain when his dead lips can talk;
they can't lie. But the Greek who is to be believed
does not live," said another.</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried Judas, and his men slunk away
under his indignant look, as hounds when whipped
back from the prey they have caught and are waiting
to tear.</p>

<p>Judas again addressed the prisoner:</p>

<p>"Captain Dion, by the gateway after Emmaus
you gave me your hand in voluntary alliance. No
one compelled that act. I then believed yours to
be an honest hand. I will not now fling it from me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
unless you yourself shall show that it is unworthy
another honest man's touch. Explain your conduct
at Bethzur."</p>

<p>Dion advanced a step. He bowed very low.</p>

<p>"My thanks, Maccabæus! An honest man can
ask no more than you have granted me."</p>

<p>He then put his arm about the shoulder of his
fellow-prisoner.</p>

<p>"This man, Maccabæus, is my father, General
Agathocles, the commander of the last phalanx of
your foes to fly from the field of Bethzur. Do with
us what you will."</p>

<p>The crowd surged in again, and stared at the
noted captive. A huzza broke forth. Was it in self-gratulation
that so important a foeman had fallen
into their hands? Or was it elicited by the dramatic
nature of the scene, as father and son thus stood
defenceless except for their mutual embrace? Judas
rose from his seat.</p>

<p>"God forbid that even in war there should be
such miscarriage as that a son's hand should be
raised against him who begat him."</p>

<p>Simon interposed, "If they be father and son, it
does not disprove their treason."</p>

<p>"Perhaps accounts for it," said Eliezar, with a
shrug.</p>

<p>"Silence, my brothers!" commanded Judas.</p>

<p>Turning to the elder prisoner, he asked:</p>

<p>"Are you General Agathocles? Does Dion speak
truth?"</p>

<p>The venerable Greek stood erect, yet trembled with
rage, as he replied:</p>

<p>"Maccabæus, never before has man questioned the
truthfulness of either Agathocles or his son without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
biting the dust. Give me my sword, and let the
gods decide betwixt us."</p>

<p>"Your pardon," instantly replied Judas. "God
forbid that I should wrong one in bonds!"</p>

<p>The Greek as quickly rejoined, and with equal
courtesy:</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Maccabæus! I forget that I am
your prisoner, and that the question is right. Let
me speak further. There has been no treason to
either Jew or Greek. I was fairly taken in fight.
Dion's sword, wielded in your service, conquered
mine. This wound"&mdash;pointing to the bruise upon
his forehead&mdash;"is the witness. But one sword, Maccabæus,
could have accomplished this&mdash;not your
own, though so famed for its skill and weight. Only
the arm that Agathocles has trained could get the
better of Agathocles himself&mdash;if it be not bombast
for an old man to say such things. I was first my
own Dion's captive before I became yours. Treat
me as any other whom your men have taken. War
asks no mercy. Do with me as you will. And for
Dion, I ask only your justice, Maccabæan."</p>

<p>"Both shall have justice," replied Judas. "But
what is justice? God is just, and we&mdash;we are only
men."</p>

<p>He sat down again upon the broken statue of
Hermes, and with his sword-point drew lines upon
the ground.</p>

<p>"In one of his moods again," whispered Simon.</p>

<p>But the spell was quickly off. He stood up. His
sword trembled in his hand from the nervous tension
with which he grasped it.</p>

<p>"General Agathocles, you are my prisoner. I must
maintain discipline."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is just and wise, if an old man of many
wars may counsel a younger one. Maintain discipline,
or abandon the art of war. Do with me according
to your custom."</p>

<p>"We have no custom in this regard," replied Judas.
"It is not our wont to take prisoners. But I will
imitate a custom of your own service, hard and
cruel though it often is. With the Greeks the captive
is the spoil of his captor, to kill, sell, or keep
as his slave. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"It is so," replied Agathocles.</p>

<p>"Then," said Judas, "Captain Dion, do with this
man what you will. He is your prisoner."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of dissent from the crowd.
Judas walked away. He picked up the rusted discus,
and flung it ringing along the pavement until
it turned upon its edge and rolled out of sight
down the slope of Ophel.</p>

<p>"Humph!" ejaculated Jonathan, as he watched
him. "He has been fighting with himself to-day,
Simon, and as usual he got the worst of it. Well,
Judas is the only man that can conquer Judas,
thank the Lord!"</p>

<p>"But why," said Simon, "should Judas be an
enemy to himself? There are surely enough other
foes for him, without his throwing away his own
interests. He has put a scorpion into his sandal in
sparing these Greeks. If your surmise about Deborah
and Dion be correct, he would better have
made way with them both."</p>

<p>"If my surmise be correct," replied Jonathan,
"making way with Dion would not make way for
Judas with a woman like the daughter of Elkiah."</p>

<p>Judas on leaving Ophel strode through the Cheese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>makers'
Street, turned into the Street of David, and
went to the house of Elkiah.</p>

<p>Deborah was pale as one worn with some great
care or long watching. Judas scarcely noted this.
Indeed, he forgot the usual formality of salutation
as he was admitted into her presence, but burst
through the curtained doorway, his big voice ringing
out the news like a trumpet announcing victory.</p>

<p>"Dion is not a traitor! He is exonerated!"</p>

<p>He grasped both her hands in the eagerness with
which he told the turn of affairs. Her beaming
gratification led him to more enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Agathocles is like Dion. Though in a Greek,
good blood will tell. It is like a spring in a muddy
lake."</p>

<p>"But tell me more of the evidence in his favor,"
she asked. "The circumstances surely seemed
against Dion. Everybody condemned him. Tell me
everything. How was it proved that there was no
collusion between the father and son? Who testified
for them?"</p>

<p>"Why, nobody testified on their side," said Judas,
as if the need of such testimony had occurred to him
for the first time. "My brothers were for condemning
them both."</p>

<p>"And you had secret knowledge of their innocence?"</p>

<p>"None&mdash;and yet, Deborah, there were two things
which persuaded me. The one was the bearing of
the men. I cannot weigh arguments, but I know
men. Goodness, honesty, honor&mdash;I feel these things
in men. I have never been betrayed where I have
given my confidence. Sincerity is like sunshine; it is
its own evidence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>"True; and the other thing which persuaded you
to Dion's innocence?" she asked.</p>

<p>Judas mused for a while; then he said:</p>

<p>"Dion had an advocate."</p>

<p>"Who?" exclaimed she. "I thought all were
against him."</p>

<p>"Not all, Deborah. As I sat there to judge, you
yourself seemed to stand before me. You said, 'I
have trusted this man; and will trust him. One
who has done such things for my father's house
cannot be untrue to any one or to any cause.' And,
Deborah, you won your case&mdash;as you always do
with me."</p>

<p>"Judas," replied she, "God is in this matter. I
was with you, though I knew it not. I was in
prayer. I used the very words you have just spoken.
I said, 'O Lord, I have trusted this man. One who
has done such things for my father's house cannot
be untrue.' I prayed that Heaven would send his
vindication."</p>

<p>"Deborah," replied Judas, "are we two so near to
each other that soul speaks to soul without words?"</p>

<p>"God is near to us both, Judas. This I know.
He leads me, and He leads you, as He leads all men
by you. And what think you, my brother&mdash;for such,
and father, too, you are to me&mdash;is not God near to
some Gentiles&mdash;to Dion? He has given this man
our faith, our spirit of sacrifice, though he is separated
from us in blood."</p>

<p>The conversation was broken into by a loud outcry
in the court, which rang through the house and
seemed to fall back again in shatters out of the
sky.</p>

<p>"Dion's free! Dion's free!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Meph. The only check to the lad's joy was
the fact that he was not the first to bring the tidings,
as he supposed he was&mdash;and rightly, from the
way he had exercised his crutch in getting over
from Ophel. His disappointment was only partially
mitigated by the fact that he had been outstripped
as a herald by no one except the great Judas himself.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span> Dion and Agathocles went their way
from the trial scene on Ophel, they
narrated to each other the events of
the score of years of their separation.</p>

<p>During Dion's childhood the war between
Macedonia and Rome was in progress. General
Agathocles had been commissioned by King
Philip to proceed to Italy, and there, if possible,
negotiate terms of peace. During his journey he was
set upon by bandits, his credentials from the King
stolen with his baggage. Entering Roman territory
he was seized by the military authorities, who had
been warned of his coming as a Macedonian spy;
and, having no documents to disprove the charge,
he was sentenced to the life of a quarry slave in one
of the many isles which the blustering Republic was
constantly adding to its domains. Here he remained
for a score of years, until the overthrow of Philip's
ill-fated son, Perseus, at the battle of Pydna, made
Macedonia no longer a menace to Roman dictation
over the entire country between the Adriatic and
Ægean. Since the veteran warrior was supposed to
have no longer cause in which to draw his sword, it
was restored to his hand.</p>

<p>But the years of his degradation and cruel maltreatment
had grown in the gallant man such
hatred of Rome that he quickly sought an occasion
in which to display it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>At his liberation Greece was helpless at the Roman's
feet, but the kindred Greek monarchy of Syria
presented itself as an obstacle to further conquest
of the republic in the east. Agathocles therefore
hastened to offer his service to Antiochus.</p>

<p>Had not this political motive actuated the old
warrior, a more tender incentive would have been
sufficient for his joining the Syrians. In Macedonia
he learned that Dion was still living, and that he
had joined the army of Antiochus. Agathocles soon
traced his son to the forces operating against Palestine;
and, after campaigning for awhile in Persia
and C&oelig;le-Syria, he secured his own transference to
the army under Lycias. This Governor hailed the
old soldier, whose reputation had survived the years
of his supposed death, and gave him command of
a Macedonian contingent.</p>

<p>"But how came you, Dion, to join with these
Jews?"</p>

<p>"My father, I have never forgotten the words you
spoke to me when a child&mdash;though your face and
form had faded from my memory. You taught me
always to hate a tyrant. Then Rome was the taskmaster
of Macedonia. In hatred of Rome I gave my
sword to Antiochus just as you did. In my ignorance
I imagined that he might some day come to
be the avenger of our country's disgrace. But Antiochus
is himself a monster, such as even Italy cannot
breed. In his army here I found myself a tool
of an atrocious despot. Father, it was because I
am son of an Agathocles that I gave myself to these
poor people who are defending their land, their
homes, their altars, from this ravening beast."</p>

<p>"Had you no other thought, my son?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not at first," said Dion, "but I have since learned
to believe in the religion of these people. They worship
with sincerity. We are hypocrites. What Greek
would shed a tear if his carved god were taken
away? But these Jews bleed at the heart for the
sacrilege Antiochus offers in Jerusalem. I have seen
old men drop dead beside their desecrated altars&mdash;dead
from the shock of their grief at the dishonoring
of their God. I have seen others die with such
tranquillity of mind amid outward torture that I
could not but believe that their souls were drawn
from their bodies by the kiss of the divinity they
prayed to. Father, I have seen peasants who had
never practised foil or been in a battle, suddenly
gifted with skill to overthrow the armies of Apollonius
and Seron and Gorgias and Lycias. What
is the meaning of such things as you and I saw at
Bethzur, but that this Judas hurls the very bolts
of Jove or of his Jehovah of Hosts, as the people
call their God? I have seen a woman of the Jews,
a mere girl in years, do deeds such as are scarcely
invented in our stories. She is possessed of more
wisdom in council than a tentful of our Generals.
She believes that her God helps her&mdash;and so do I."</p>

<p>"Is she a beautiful woman?" queried Agathocles,
with a knowing glance at his companion.</p>

<p>"Aye, the fairest of women, father. Pygmalion
would have thrown away his chisel if he had seen
the daughter of Elkiah."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it, since my Dion has evidently
thrown away his Greek sword for her sake."</p>

<p>"Not for her sake, father; but for the sake of a
cause which produces such a woman and such men,
such faith and such heroism."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>"And such beauty. Eh, my boy? Have I not
been young? Dion, you are in love with this woman,
up to your eyebrows, and therefore can see nothing
except through her shape. The mists on the shore
make pebbles look like castles, so the witchery of
this beauty magnifies everything Jewish. Hush,
boy! I know it. I have been as young as you."</p>

<p>Both lapsed into silence, except for an occasional
ejaculation from Agathocles: "A Jewess! Well, why
not? One must love something."</p>

<p>Was the old soldier merely tantalizing the young
man, or was he voyaging over the seas of memory?
At length he put his hand upon Dion's shoulder.</p>

<p>"This Jewess, my boy; is she very fair? Is she
like the picture of your mother?"</p>

<p>"No, father; she is very different. Yet in soul they
must be like; for surely the gods&mdash;surely the Lord
could not make two so faultless without repeating
the model."</p>

<p>"And she a Jewess! Well! well!"</p>

<h2>XLVII<br />

<span class="smaller">A QUEEN OF ISRAEL?</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t1.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> victory at Bethzur betokened a
lengthened peace, for campaigns in
other parts of his wide empire were
absorbing the mind and resources of
Antiochus. Judas took the opportunity
to renovate Jerusalem as befitted the capital
of the new nation. The immense spoils of recent
victories went far toward providing means for refurnishing
the Temple and palace; while the repute
of Judas brought him such offered alliances as assured
the safety and growing importance of his
rule.</p>

<p>Some would have installed the hero in the office
of High Priest, and thus combined all civil and religious
authority in the one person. To this he
would give no ear. The multitude hailed him with
the title of King. This also he repudiated, saying,
"I am not of the house of David, and none but the
predicted One shall come to His throne." But no
disclaimer on his part could prevent the enthusiastic
huzzas when he passed along the streets or visited
the camps on the hillsides. At times the word
"Messiah" was heard. It never failed to bring such
rebuke that the same lips dared not repeat the acclaim.
The people after a time acquired the habit
of greeting him with silent obeisance, for they knew
that his great heart was hurt rather than elated
by their praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet ambition was not foreign to the soul of Judas
Maccabæus. If God had given him power, was
he not to use it? If Israel was again resplendent,
should not the chieftain of Israel wear the dignity?
One thing he saw with special clearness&mdash;it was
that authority must be centralized and compactly
knit if it were to endure the fraying of factions;
and, further, that it must be perpetuated in orderly
descent if it were to outlive the generation which
created it.</p>

<p>This latter consideration, that of an hereditary
leadership, was incessantly urged by his brethren.
At length Judas gave signs of yielding to their importunities.</p>

<p>"I see it," said he. "The rule of new Israel must
descend from father to son. Then let Simon be King,
or Jonathan."</p>

<p>"We dare not," replied Simon. "While Judas lives
it were blasphemy to speak another name. The
sword of the Lord is the sword of Judas. That
Israel and its enemies know full well. King Judas!"
cried he, waving his sword.</p>

<p>Every sword in the little circle was uplifted, while
a reverent "Amen!" went round.</p>

<p>"I want no such thing as a crown," said Judas.</p>

<p>"Nor," rejoined Jonathan, "did you want to lead
us in the field. For how many moons did you refuse
to command, until it was clear that the people
would follow none other? Judas is brave; but not
Judas himself dare fight against the will of heaven."</p>

<p>"Well! A King! What then?" replied he after a
pause.</p>

<p>"To marry. To found the Maccabæan dynasty,"
said Simon, glancing for approval around the circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>Judas seemed staggered by the burden which was
being bound upon him.</p>

<p>"Let him alone awhile," suggested Simon. "He
sees the necessity, and will conquer himself in this
as in other matters."</p>

<p>The day following Judas went to the house of
Elkiah.</p>

<p>Long time he and Deborah conversed about the
new hopes of Israel. Judas told of the embassage
he was sending to Rome, of the service General
Agathocles might render in Egypt, where the veteran
was favorably known and where the age-long
jealousy of the Ptolemies against the Seleucidæ was
always ready to burst into hostilities. They spoke
together with pious enthusiasm of the restored glory
of the Temple, and the restitution of the ancient
dignity of the priesthood.</p>

<p>The clouds were for the time lifted from the brow
of the champion. Deborah noted the change. She
had never thought of her friend as of prepossessing
appearance; but now his strong and rugged features
grew softer. There was a boyishness in his tone
and manner which better suited his years than they
did his experiences of exploit and care. She began
to regard him as handsome. Deborah, in her modesty,
as little suspected the cause of this transformation
in her guest as the sun is conscious of his
agency in brightening the objects he shines upon.</p>

<p>"The Lord has blessed me in two respects especially,"
said Judas, giving free rein to speech and
feeling. "The spirit of our father, Mattathias, has
been given to my brethren, any one of the four being
fitted to take up the leadership if I should lay
it down. With Simon to counsel, and Jonathan to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
plan, and Eliezar and John to strike, I am like one
with four right arms. And, Deborah, God has given
me your companionship. Without that I should
have lost heart."</p>

<p>"Your words give me great joy," replied she, "for
during these terrible years I have had one prayer
deeper than all others&mdash;it has been for you; and
that I might, however humbly, cheer and sustain
you as became a daughter of Israel."</p>

<p>"And you will continue your sweet and helpful
ministry, will you not?" he asked eagerly. "In this
day of our prosperity I shall need you even more
than in the past. I am accustomed to war; I have
become, perhaps, too self-reliant there. But I know
not how to organize peace. My hands are too hard
for anything but swinging the sword. Alas! as Solomon
said on coming to his throne, 'I am as a little
child, and know not how to go out or come in.'
Deborah, promise me that you will still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him with eager, almost passionate,
remonstrance: "Promise you? Judas, do I need to
promise you anything? Do you not know that your
own heart is not truer to our cause than mine is
to you? If Judas should doubt me, it would kill
me. Tell me some desperate venture by which I
can prove my loyalty. Test me, I beg you."</p>

<p>"Some desperate venture? I know of one that will
test us both. It is so desperate that I hesitate to
speak it to the bravest woman of all Jewry."</p>

<p>What sublime audacity there was in her tone as
she replied: "If the champion of Israel is afraid,
let him not speak it. But know that the daughter
of Elkiah dares to hear and to do whatever Judas
may think."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>"Such words would make any coward brave," replied
he. "Deborah, the Jews would make me
King."</p>

<p>"A King! Why not? You are already the King,
by right of sword, by right of your people's love,
and, if Heaven's will ever had reflection from earth,
by the will of our God."</p>

<p>"You believe in me overmuch, Deborah."</p>

<p>"No! no!" she responded eagerly, "but Judas has
this one great weakness, that he will not believe
in himself. Can you not see that Israel must have
a King, and that there is but one head on which
the people will allow a crown to rest?"</p>

<p>"But, Deborah, I could not endure such an honor
and such responsibility&mdash;alone. Will you share the
venture with me? Will the Daughter of Jerusalem
be its Queen?"</p>

<p>Deborah started as if he had struck her. The
flush on her face became deathly pallor. She trembled
as the most timid girl might have done before
her captor in war.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Deborah. I was too rude in testing
your loyalty."</p>

<p>The blood came back to her cheeks. "Loyalty!
Say not that word. Let Maccabæus as King command
me, and I will die at his feet. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sat upon the couch and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Forgive me! Forgive me!" he cried. "What
have I said? I was blind and stupid. Loyalty?
Loyalty I know is not love."</p>

<p>After a moment's silence she said: "Judas, we
are both speaking we know not what. I, too, am
but a child, and know not the way of my own
thoughts. Do not take offence, my dear friend; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
would be alone. Pray for me. And I will pray for
you, as I have always prayed&mdash;one prayer for us
both. God will give us light."</p>

<p>"Your will shall be mine," he responded, but his
manner betokened a struggle for submission such
as no one had ever before seen in this strongest of
men. He stood with bowed head. "We are but
two children lost in the woods. God forbid that
we must now find our way by different paths."</p>

<p>He went away.</p>

<p>Deborah remained for a long time in the spot
where Judas left her.</p>

<p>"A Queen! A Queen of Israel! The Queen of the
most kingly of men, though he were uncrowned!"
What problems of political import were thus thrust
upon her! What tides of ambition swept over her!
The highest, deepest, purest ambition. She grew
dizzy with the confusion of her thoughts. Their
very weight seemed to paralyze her brain. She
ceased to think, and sat down like one distraught.</p>

<p>At length her mind, rested by its brief vacuity,
began again its working.</p>

<p>"A Queen!"</p>

<p>She dismissed this consideration; for, momentous
as was the destiny it involved, there was something
else that appealed more urgently for decision. She
was a woman. To her a throne seemed but a passing
circumstance. There was a deeper issue.</p>

<p>"Love is the abiding thing. Can I be&mdash;the wife
of Judas? Could this man, noble as he is, possess
my life, my soul? Is admiration, or even reverence
and self-sacrificing devotion&mdash;is this love? Or does
the soul have depths as well as heights; and does
worshipful regard dwell on the heights, and love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
in the depths, so that they may be utterly remote
from each other, indeed, antagonistic? Dion is not
comparable with Judas. Judas is on the heights;
nothing higher, save God Himself. But Dion&mdash;he
has his place, too; but where?"</p>

<p>She now remembered that the beginning of Gideon
ben Sirach's story, which had so nearly made a Jew
of the Greek, started in her a glow of happiness,
and that she had felt a strange disappointment at
its conclusion, which still left him a Greek. What
did this experience mean? Did she really love this
alien? As one of foreign blood he could never come
into her life. The laws of her people, especially as
interpreted by the Jewish purists, would forbid
such a thing as marriage with him. She had been
taught this doctrine by her father. It was one of
the underlying occasions of the war. The Maccabæans
regarded pure blood as next to the purity
of worship.</p>

<p>So she said, "Dion cannot come into my life."</p>

<p>Then, having settled the matter so far, she thought
of Judas:</p>

<p>"What other woman of Israel would presume to
decline such a proposal? And who am I to set an
example of conceit?</p>

<p>"The Queen of Israel!"</p>

<p>Deborah felt the flush of womanly pride mantle
her face. It was a moment when almost any other
woman would have turned first to her mirror, and
then dropped upon her knees to thank God.</p>

<p>But even as she framed the image of the popular
hero within the thought of her personal possession
of him, the figure of the Greek intruded itself
into the picture. His image was in the background,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
it is true; but there it was, nevertheless. She could
not help following him with the eyes of her fancy.
Was not Dion's soul as fine-fibred as that of Judas?</p>

<p>Judas had sublime faith; but this he had inherited
from his fathers. It was wrought through and
through his nature by training in the Law since
childhood. But Dion now had the same faith. And
this he had himself acquired, without gift of birth,
education, or circumstance. Is it not even nobler
to force one's mind through a thousand errors to
the truth than to have the truth born in one, to
discover one's pearl after delving the seas for it,
than to find it in one's ancestral treasure-box?</p>

<p>Judas had risked his life for the cause of Israel.
But had not Dion done as much in abandoning
what seemed to him all the good of life in order
to cast in his lot with the people of God?</p>

<p>Perhaps Deborah did not deliberately and of intent
carry on this comparison. The thought of the
Greek came into her mind of itself. She drove it
out as she would have frightened a sparrow away
from the lattice.</p>

<p>She then indulged the reminiscence of the various
ways in which, since she had dedicated her life to
her country, she had been useful to Judas. She did
not doubt, even in her humility, that he spoke honestly
when he said that he needed her. But the
sparrow came back to the lattice. Had not God
also led her to help this Greek to his better faith?
And did not he need her?</p>

<p>She drove the sparrow away. She said that it
should never come again. But, even as she said
so, the sparrow twittered at the lattice.</p>

<p>She became puzzled with her question, "Why can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
I only by positive effort exclude this man from my
mind? Why are his face, and form, and accents,
and traits, and offered love always with me? Why
does he press upon me as the daylight against the
window, to be excluded only by drawing close the
curtain?"</p>

<p>She had often observed a spring in the meadow,
which the herdsmen tried to fill up and destroy;
yet it broke out again, because its veins were deep
and full beneath the earth. Was there such a spring
of love for the Greek in her heart?</p>

<p>Then her problem became one of casuistry.
Would it be right for her to give herself to Judas
when she could not exclude another man from her
thoughts, though he could not come into her life?
Would not that be essential meretriciousness?</p>

<p>She had schooled herself to the habit of quick
decision. So now she would pronounce judgment.
Judges on the bench sometimes grow pale when
they realize the immense consequences of their renderings;
so Deborah, rapidly as her mind worked,
passed an hour in a tragedy. She rose from the
controversy strangely unnerved, until she steadied
herself with her indomitable will. She stood out in
the light that came through the latticed window,
streaming in the last ray of the sunset. She hesitated
to say the fateful words, which she knew
must not be recalled, for she could not endure a repetition
of the debate. Her face was uplifted to the
sun-gleam; her hands tightly clenched behind her
back&mdash;just her attitude, she remembered, when she
made up her mind to become a spy three years ago,
there in the ravine by the Fort of the Rocks. Her
lips moved. Her words came heavy and cold, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
she had been changed from a living woman into a
speaking statue:</p>

<p>"The Greek cannot come into my life. Nor&mdash;can&mdash;my&mdash;life&mdash;enter&mdash;into&mdash;that&mdash;of&mdash;Judas.
God help
me!"</p>

<p>She threw herself upon the divan, and the sun
went down.</p>

<h2>XLVIII<br />

<span class="smaller">A BROKEN SENTENCE FINISHED</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-g.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">General</span> Agathocles recognized the
magnanimity of Judas in granting him
the alternative of remaining in Jerusalem
under the honorable guard of
Dion, or of joining his own people. He
chose the latter course. Yet from day to day he
postponed his departure. It was whispered that his
fatherly affection and authority would ultimately
win back his son from his Jewish allegiance; but a
few, among them Jonathan, shook their heads at
this.</p>

<p>At length the General must take up his journey.</p>

<p>"My son, it may be&mdash;but the gods forbid it&mdash;that
we shall not meet again. I would always keep you
in my mind as in a mirror. It will not be enough
that I learn of your welfare, and your doings; I
would make your very thoughts my own, and so
live within your life, be it glad or sorrowful. You
have revealed to me that much of your thought
will be given to this woman you have learned to
love. May she prove all that your partiality has
dreamed her to be! But beware! We do not love
our ideal, so much as we idealize what we love. I
would see this woman, so that I may know more
of yourself, since it is evident that her image moulds
itself in you as a seal in wax. If I can see her, I
will more plainly see you."</p>

<p>Together they sought the house of Elkiah. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
outer door being ajar they entered the court without
announcement, and without being observed by
the actors in a scene at the moment transpiring.
Dion would have advanced, but Agathocles laid his
hand upon his arm and detained him.</p>

<p>The fountain statue of Aphrodite had been removed.
The water shot up as of old in a thin
shaft, and fell in spray upon the surface of the
broad lower basin, glistening like the dust of gold
in the morning sunshine. Beside the fountain in a
great chair sat Gideon ben Sirach. Deborah was
with him. The old man's eyes seemed enchanted by
the play of the sparkling water. He extended his
hands and clutched as if to hold the warmth of the
sun that fell upon them. His features were drawn
out of shape by the palsy. Dion thought of a house
from which the occupant is about to remove, its
furniture displaced, much of it already gone; for
Sirach's face was empty of the old expression of his
soul. It was evident that much of the meaning of
his life, the furniture of his mind, had been removed
even from his memory. Deborah sat upon a little
bench, where Sirach's feet also rested. She took his
withered hands, and rubbed them as if to impart to
them some of her own vitality.</p>

<p>"You can hear to-day, Gideon?"</p>

<p>His eyes turned toward her, but his features were
as immobile as a death-mask.</p>

<p>"You have no pain, Gideon? And God's own
peace is with you? Yes, I can read it in your eyes.
Judas is now lord of Jerusalem; do you understand?
He bids me say that your master's property shall be
sacredly kept until its rightful owner comes home.
He and I will seek him. You hear, and understand?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Gideon, you are an old man, and near to the life of
the blessed. Let me put your hands upon my head,
that the daughter of Elkiah may have the blessing
of her father's friend. Here, by this very fountain,
my father and your master have often sat in the
years that are gone."</p>

<p>She bowed her head, and lifted Sirach's thin white
fingers to her black hair. So white were they that
they seemed like points of light, radiating the blessing
they would impart.</p>

<p>Agathocles whispered to Dion: "Come away!
This is no place for a stranger."</p>

<p>They walked far down the street before either of
them spoke. At length Dion awoke his father from
his reverie.</p>

<p>"You have seen her, father."</p>

<p>"There was never but one fairer woman," replied
Agathocles. "Dion, with such a woman to love
you, I could leave you willingly in Jerusalem or in
the desert. Does she give you her favor? If so, here
abide. If she will not love you, Dion, flee; flee with
me&mdash;to the wars, over the seas, anywhere; and pray
that the gods give you every day a drink from
Lethe's waters of forgetfulness. That woman, my
boy, will fill a man's heart or break it. Does she
love you?"</p>

<p>"I would that I knew, father."</p>

<p>"Then find out, and at once. If so, stay here.
Become a Jew, an Arab, or what she bids you.
Her answer will make Jerusalem either Elysium or
Tartarus for you."</p>

<p>"But," replied Dion, "I would that you knew her.
I may not tell her that my father left the city without
caring to speak a word with her. Though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
love me not, I have been too intimate in the house
of Elkiah for so unkindly a departure."</p>

<p>"It shall be as you say," replied the General.
"What women these Jews have! Dion&mdash;but no&mdash;I will
not say it; for what slips down from the lips never
climbs back again. Let us go again to the house
of Elkiah. An old Greek never loses his gallantry.
If your heart fails you, Dion, I will pay my own
homage at her feet. Does that prick you?
Come."</p>

<p>When they re-entered the court, Deborah had
risen. She stood by the chair, holding Sirach's
hands and gazing closely into his eyes. Hearing
footsteps, and supposing them to be those of the
servants, she did not turn to look, but cried:</p>

<p>"Quick! Help! Sirach is stricken. See! His eyes
do not follow one. I fear he is dead. Sirach! Gideon!
Alas, he does not hear."</p>

<p>The two men drew near. Deborah, absorbed with
the face that was growing rigid, and with the hands
that were becoming as lead in her grasp, did not
recognize the visitors. Agathocles startled her. Forgetting
that he was a stranger, and caught by sudden
emotion, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"By all the gods! It is Sirach, servant of Shattuck!
How came this man here? Dion, tell me,
knew you this man?"</p>

<p>Then, the first surprise past, the General made
his obeisance to Deborah, as Dion announced his
name:</p>

<p>"My father, General Agathocles, begs to salute
the daughter of Elkiah before he leaves the city."</p>

<p>Deborah rose. The gracefulness of her courtesy
as she recognized her visitors matched her beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
The Greek afterward said it was as fitting as the
light is to the flame which emits it.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to our home, sir, both for
your own sake and the sake of Dion. But do you
know this good man whom God has just taken
from us?"</p>

<p>"I knew him," replied the Greek, bowing beside
the stiffening form. "I knew Gideon ben Sirach.
And aye for a good man too."</p>

<p>He raised the deformed arm of the dead man, and
pressed it to his lips. He drew up Sirach's loose
sleeve, and looked long upon a terrible scar that
lay among the shrivelled muscles. Then, speaking
to himself, seemingly unaware that he was uttering
his thoughts aloud:</p>

<p>"To this poor hand, good Gideon, do I not owe
more than to any other, living or dead? These arms
brought me my greatest treasure&mdash;the only treasure
I would live for, or die for."</p>

<p>Then, raising his face as if to discern the spirit
of Sirach hovering above his body, as it was believed
by many in that age that newly departed
spirits were loath to venture suddenly out upon
the great unknown journey, and remained for a
while near to their former house of clay&mdash;he said:</p>

<p>"Gideon, let me speak the gratitude that I have
longed these years to tell into your living ears. Sirach!
Alas, I have found him too late. My thanks,
good lady, to all in this house that such a man
came to no want in his last days."</p>

<p>Agathocles noted the surprise upon his son's face,
and, looking anxiously from one to another, asked:</p>

<p>"Did Sirach ever tell his story in this house?"</p>

<p>"We know his story," replied Deborah. "Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
was man more faithful to man than this man has
been."</p>

<p>Agathocles took from her words more than she
had meant.</p>

<p>"O Gideon! Gideon! why were not your lips
stricken dumb before they had uttered it?"</p>

<p>He shook the dead body in anger. "Gideon, you
gave me my boy. Why did you steal him away
from me?"</p>

<p>He turned back and paced the court in his excitement.
Suddenly he stopped before Dion.</p>

<p>"Now I know why you would be a Jew. It was
because you knew that you are one. But I swear
by all the gods! I swear by the memory of my
sweet Agnes! Dion, you are mine. Sirach lied to
you. Believe him not. Dion, you are my boy."</p>

<p>He held the young man fast as he would some
captive seeking to escape.</p>

<p>"And ever shall be yours, my father," replied
Dion.</p>

<p>"Father? Say it again, Dion. That is a sweet
word from your lips&mdash;sweet as were the kisses of
your mother. Swear to me, Dion, that not even
Gideon's story shall separate us."</p>

<p>"I swear it by Sirach's corpse that you are my
father, and ever shall be."</p>

<p>"Well, then"&mdash;taking Dion's cheeks between his
hands&mdash;"then believe Sirach. He has spoken the
truth."</p>

<p>"But this is strange," replied the young man.
"Gideon mentioned not your name, father. He told
us a story of Ctesiphon, the friend of one Nahum."</p>

<p>"He spake not my name at all? He told you not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
that Agathocles was not your father? Then, Gideon,
you were faithful to me. But why, now, did not
those still lips open and check mine before they had
uttered the fatal words? But let it be so, since
Dion is still my own."</p>

<p>"But who, then, was Ctesiphon, father?"</p>

<p>Agathocles stood a moment in thought. He then
took Dion's arm and led him away.</p>

<p>"Come, my boy; this is no place for us. Pardon
me, my lady; let us not intrude these matters of
our privacy. We will come again, and take part
in honoring Sirach in his burial."</p>

<p>But what change had come over the fair woman?
As the Greek had seen her sitting by the side of the
dead man, he noted how pale she was within the
hood of her raven hair; how Niobe-like was her
attitude. Now she was transformed, radiant; the
blood tingeing her cheeks like sunshine on snow. Her
lips seemed to be about to utter some passionate
cry. Her hand clasped that of Dion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was another who saw this tableau and
knew its meaning. Judas Maccabæus had entered
the court at the moment, and, as his custom was,
without heralding. He paused by the entrance. He
took in at a glance all the scene,&mdash;and saw also
some things which were not outwardly acted. Noting
that he had been unobserved, he went silently
out, and with bowed head tramped along the Street
of David, through the Cheesemakers' Street, and
out to the Hill of Ophel, where he sat long upon
a ruined coping of the Gymnasium, and gazed down
the Valley of Kedron, and over the slopes of the
mountains of the Wilderness. But, as Meph, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
had followed him, said to a comrade, "Judas looked,
but he saw nothing."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Deborah had led her visitors into a room adjacent
to the court. Here Agathocles narrated that part of
Sirach's story which the old servant's sudden infirmity,
many days before, had cut short.</p>

<p>"Ctesiphon! Well did Sirach give him praise. It
was Ctesiphon who dared to plead for the Jews
before the raging Ptolemy. It was he who, when the
elephants were about to trample the Jews in the arena,
went in among them, and dragged Nahum away.</p>

<p>"Nahum's daughter, Sara, was at the time concealed
at my house. I had loved my neighbor's
child alway, though we were of different races.
After King Ptolemy's rage had abated&mdash;thanks
chiefly to Ctesiphon's influence with the King&mdash;the
Jews often came to my house when they visited their
kinsman Nahum. Thus I often saw your father,
Shattuck. He was a princely fellow; of wondrous
gentility; and withal as much shrewdness as any of
his race. My money I left with him, sure of its
proper usury. He soon won the affection of Sara,
and they were betrothed and wedded according to
their nation's custom. The coming of Sara's child,
and the death of Shattuck, her husband, were near
together. The attempt upon little Gershom's life
led me to take Sara and her babe to my home. To
better protect her from unknown enemies I brought
her to Macedonia. There she became my wife. She
took the name of Agnes for better concealment of
her identity. Her child Gershom she consented to
call Dion. But this is no place to open the memories
of a broken heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose to go away. Deborah besought him to
remain.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he replied, and he passed into the
street, leaving Dion to piece together the story as he
might; or, if he cared, to begin his own life-story
anew.</p>

<p>An hour later a horn sounded from the parapet of
the house of Elkiah; for such was the custom of the
Jews, that the passers-by might know that death
was within the walls. They washed the body of
Sirach, trimmed the hair and nails, and wrapped
him in new white linen. They laid the form upon a
bier. A rabbi came, and spoke words of eulogy over
a faithful servant. Women entered the court, with
dishevelled hair, and, to the accompaniment of flutes,
chanted a weird mourning dirge, and cast dust of
ashes toward the body.</p>

<p>About sunset a little procession emerged from the
house. Ephraim would have taken the position of
chief mourner, as befitted his condition at a fellow-servant's
burial; but Agathocles displaced him, and
walked nearest to the bier. Dion went by his side.</p>

<p>Thus they buried Gideon ben Sirach on the slope
of the vale of Jehoshaphat, in the family tomb of the
house of Shattuck&mdash;for so Dion, now Gershom ben
Shattuck, ordered it to be.</p>

<h2>XLIX<br />

<span class="smaller">THE HIDDEN HAND</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-f.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">From</span> the burial of Gideon ben Sirach,
Dion and Agathocles walked leisurely
back toward the city. They had much
to talk about, both of the past and
future, and took a path less frequented
than the common road.</p>

<p>Not far from the city gate stood a beggar. His
filthy hair matted itself about his head, and fell upon
his bare and begrimed shoulders. His chief garment
might have been the remnant of a wine-skin, which
was tied with strings about the upper part of his
body. His legs and feet were bare&mdash;an advantage
to such creatures, for his lower limbs at least would
get a bath of air and sunshine, and that of an
occasional shower. About his neck hung a basket
which made its mute solicitation for alms.</p>

<p>"These fellows are as proud as priests," said Dion.
"They will ask nothing of us, and will thank us for
nothing we give."</p>

<p>"He poses like the statue of a god I once saw in
Cyprus," commented Agathocles. "They had just
dug it up out of the mud, and hadn't scraped it."</p>

<p>"Don't go near him," replied Dion. "His filth
doubtless has wings. Yet it is well to give him a
stater. He is supposed to mumble a blessing, and I
need one."</p>

<p>Dion advanced toward the man, and put his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
into his bosom to draw his purse. The beggar
sprang upon him with a cry of fury.</p>

<p>"At last I have you, you damned whelp of Shattuck!"</p>

<p>He drew a knife from beneath his dirty sheep-skin,
and aimed a blow at the breast of Dion. The thrust
had surely done its intended work, but for the quick
evasion of the practised soldier. Before the wretch
could repeat the blow Dion had closed with him,
grasped the uplifted arm with his left hand, and
with a dexterous wrench bent his assailant until his
head and heels nearly touched; then laid him on the
ground.</p>

<p>Agathocles started to help. He was instantly confronted
by another person who darted from behind
a great olive-tree. But the General had drawn his
sword. The villain, though armed with a dagger,
dared not venture the encounter. He turned to flee;
but the weapon of Agathocles was through his
body.</p>

<p>Dion stood a moment over the beggar he had felled.</p>

<p>"What madness is this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Kill the wretch," cried Agathocles.</p>

<p>"Nay, father, my sword would not drink such
foul blood."</p>

<p>They tied the wrists of the living man with the
stout cords of his beggar's basket.</p>

<p>"Why this assault?" asked Dion. "Were you mad
with hunger?"</p>

<p>"Aye, hunger for you," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Dion.</p>

<p>"The scar on your forehead knows me, if you do
not. But for the man you have just buried, you
had never had tongue to ask who I am."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ought to know this man's face," said Agathocles,
studying him closely. "For years I have seen
these eyes, like those of a panther as it slinks away
from one it dares not attack. In Alexandria, in
Macedon, in Rome, I have seen these same eyes
spying on me. Let me squeeze his secret out of
him."</p>

<p>The General's hands were upon the man's throat.</p>

<p>"I am Cleon. Do you know me now?" gasped the
wretch.</p>

<p>"Cleon? There was a Cleon in Alexandria, a vile
procurer for the beastly Ptolemy. Yes, those eyes
are Cleon's, as sure as ever snake owned his. But
I never harmed you, Cleon. Why do you pursue
me?"</p>

<p>"You lie!" wheezed the man. "You were always
in my way. You call me a snake. Well! have you
not both writhed when I bit you? You, Dion, have
drunk my poison; and the great Agathocles was in
the mines in Sicily, where I&mdash;I&mdash;Cleon sent him. I
have had my vengeance. Now take yours."</p>

<p>"I see it all," said the General. "This Cleon, panderer
to the vilest folk of Alexandria, was the agent
of those who would have stolen the estate of Shattuck,
but for the influence of Ctesiphon and myself,
and the help of Gideon. It was Cleon's hand that
struck you, Dion, when a babe; the mark of which
blow Gideon carried to his grave. It was the same
hand that mixed the poison for us both in Macedonia.
It was this man's tongue, black with perjury,
that gave the lying information against me to the
Romans."</p>

<p>"Well, now you know me," said the man with
assumed indifference, "you can only kill me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us take him into the city," said Agathocles.
"This man is so false that I can hardly believe his
damning confession against himself without better
evidence."</p>

<p>"Not into the city! Not into the city!" cried the
captive. "Not into the city! For God's sake, kill
me here."</p>

<p>He writhed, not seemingly to break his cord, but
rather to wrest his soul from the grip of his own
body, and thus escape from life ere some deeper
curse should befall him.</p>

<p>"Not into the Holy City! Not near to the Temple!
O God of Abraham! Mercy! Mercy! Not into the
city!"</p>

<p>He raised his head, and, before his captors were
aware of his purpose, he dashed it against a stone,
as if to make an exit for the spirit that felt itself
being consigned to perdition.</p>

<p>"Ah, Cleon," said Dion, "there is a worse poison
than you have mixed for us; poison that no medicine
will purge from the blood. You have swallowed
your own memories, and they grip hard, do they?
But why should you pray to the God of the Jews?
Such a scoundrel as you cannot be Jew."</p>

<p>The man's response was a compound of the most
dreadful oaths and vilest expletives known to the
tongues of Jew or Greek.</p>

<p>"You tempt me to kill you," said Agathocles;
"but that might end your misery. We will let you
live. If you dread the Temple, then to the Temple
you shall go."</p>

<p>The commotion had drawn a crowd. Among
them was Ephraim, the old servant of Elkiah. He
at once identified Cleon as a Jew who in his youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
had been driven from Jerusalem by the libertine set
of young men, as one infected with vices which were
too fetid for even their debauched tastes. One of
his unconscionable pranks had been the defiling of
some of the sacred vessels of the Temple&mdash;which
doubtless accounted for his dread of dying near the
holy precincts. In Alexandria&mdash;so Ephraim had
heard&mdash;he had been refused admission to the Synagogue,
and had openly apostatized, assuming the
Greek name of Cleon instead of his own, Naaman.</p>

<p>The dead accomplice of the false beggar could not
be identified. He was clearly not a Jew. On his
body were found several letters written in Aramaic,
the common language of Syria and adjacent
countries. One of these read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"More money? Not an obole until your job is finished. We
cannot depend upon the fool Cleon. Go with him. Stick to his
heels. He cannot be trusted by himself. Ben Shattuck is in
Jerusalem. He is called Dion,&mdash;a captain once in the Greek
guard. But he has scented out his own Jewish blood, and will
go back to it, like a dog to his vomit. Send proof that you
have executed your business with him, or, by the tail of Satan,
I will have you accused of the crimes you have already committed."</p></div>

<p>This letter was unsigned.</p>

<p>"I should know that writing," said Dion. "It is
none other than that of Menelaos."</p>

<p>"The same, no doubt," said Ephraim, studying it
carefully. "I could tell you more of that Priest than
has yet been published. But bring not this reprobate
into the city. Maccabæus is cleansing the
place, and would not abide such foulness. My
counsel is that you deal with him here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>"Leave him to us," shouted the crowd.</p>

<p>In spite of Dion's remonstrance they tied the living
man to the body of his dead confederate, and carried
them both down to the Valley of Hinnom.</p>

<p>What things were there done may not be written.</p>

<h2>L<br />

<span class="smaller">THE VENGEANCE OF JUDAS</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> required no especial acuteness on the
part of Judas to discern the meaning
of that tableau he had witnessed in
the court of Elkiah's house, when
Deborah stood hand in hand with Dion.
It was clearly as significant to him as the fabled
scene in which Eros awakens Psyche with a kiss
would have been to Agathocles. He had also overheard
enough of the General's story to discover
that, if Dion were his rival for the affection of
Deborah, he himself, though of the blood of Mattathias,
which had been kept pure from foreign taint
through all generations, had in this respect no advantage
over his competitor. As Gershom ben
Shattuck, Dion could satisfy the strictest interpreter
of the Law. The Prophet Nehemiah himself
could have found no flaw in Shattuck's line, with
all that Reformer's zealotry against mixed marriages.</p>

<p>Strong man that Judas was, the keen eyes of
Meph, who had watched him as he came out of
Elkiah's doorway that day, noted that the giant
staggered a little, just for an instant. Others remarked
that the great man seemed unusually absorbed
with his own thoughts, and did not return
their salutation as was his custom.</p>

<p>"A big raid, doubtless, to clean out the tribesmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
from around Hebron; or a campaign in the direction
of Antioch itself," a captain of the guard was overheard
to say.</p>

<p>"Or something as momentous," was the reply of
a comrade, "for it takes a heavy project to press
Judas' head that far down upon his shoulders."</p>

<p>Judas shut himself up in his private chamber.</p>

<p>The building and the great court before the old
palace on Sion were thronged with people. Many
of these had been especially summoned by the Messiah
Malhamah, the "Anointed for War," as the nation
were content to call their leader until such
time as he was disposed to take the crown. Here
thronged priests, some greatly renowned for wisdom
and piety, but who had been long in hiding.
They came wearing the rich robes of their office
which they had treasured with their lives; though
some of these were in ragged semblance of their
former estate, having lost everything while they
were enrolled in the patriot army. There were also
in the crowd learned rabbis, who had been summoned
to give their counsel regarding the reorganization
of the state, restoring the Temple and reordering
the grades of priests according to the ancient
ritual. The bravest of the captains were there,
for Judas had announced his intention of widening
the scope of army operations, since he foresaw that
the defence of Judea depended upon the possession
of far larger areas of territory on every side.</p>

<p>Hours passed, and Judas did not appear, to meet
those whom he had summoned.</p>

<p>Simon and Jonathan at length ventured into his
presence. The champion sat by his table&mdash;an affair
of ebony and gold, once the writing-desk of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Syrian commandant, now but a fragment of its
former elegance. Its dilapidation was not out of
keeping with the aspect of the man who leaned upon
it. The powerful frame of Judas was bent as if he
had lost some thought and was seeking to rediscover
it somewhere amid the scratches on the ebony
polish. He gave his guests no greeting. One might
have imagined him a dead man but for the intent
look upon his face, and that his clenched hand now
and then beat upon the table.</p>

<p>The coming even of his brethren was an evident
intrusion, and they withdrew.</p>

<p>"What now?" said Jonathan. "I have not seen
our brother so distraught in his moodiness since
the old days in the Fort of the Rocks. There was
need of his brooding then, but not now when all
things are coming our way, as when the quails
were blown by the east wind and covered the land
to feed our fathers in the desert."</p>

<p>"But have you not noted?" asked Simon, "how
Judas comes out of his black clouds? He is always
brighter afterward, and shows us something that
none but he could have thought of. He will accept
the kingship."</p>

<p>"Brother Simon," replied Jonathan, "I like not
the look of Judas' face. He is not meditating as is
his wont. He is struggling with some rage. I once
before saw that same look on him. It was when
he crushed the skull of a Greek spy who had got
within our lines at Mizpah. A word in your ear,
Simon."</p>

<p>"It will be as safe as under an altar."</p>

<p>"A man has crossed his path."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dion."</p>

<p>"Faugh! A feather crossing the rush of a torrent!
A partridge flitting through the lair of a lion! What
cares Judas for the Greek?"</p>

<p>Jonathan took playfully the beard of Simon.
"You are called the Wise; and yet methinks you
are dull-witted. We have insisted that Judas should
be King. That is well. But you have blocked the
way of the project by insisting that he should marry
the daughter of Elkiah. This, have I not said, he
will never do."</p>

<p>"And you believe, Jonathan, that that Greek
stands in his way?" replied Simon. "This I would
not credit unless you should tell me that you yourself
had caught them in dalliance."</p>

<p>Jonathan shrugged his shoulders. "Listen!" said
he, "ears open and teeth tight, for I have never
breathed this to living man before. The night before
the battle in the Wady I followed her, for I
feared that her daring would bring her to harm.
I tracked her into the very camp of Apollonius.
May the rising moon there shatter my wits forever
if I speak not the truth! I saw this Dion come to
her. I would have slain him and her. But when
I drew to strike I overheard their words. I saw
that she was stealing this man out of the fight,
lest in the vengeance we were about to take on
Apollonius he, too, should fall. She risked her life
to give us the victory&mdash;that we know; and I know
that she risked her life for this man at the same
time. If ever woman loved a man, she loves him.
I saw that she accepted his love from the touch of
his lips."</p>

<p>Simon turned fiercely upon the speaker. "Jona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>than,
dare you impugn the loyalty of the daughter
of Elkiah? She is not a Glaucon, though she has
his blood."</p>

<p>"Her loyalty?" replied Jonathan. "I laud it. This
woman is so true to us and our people that not
even her love for this man made her swerve. And
why should she not love the Greek? He is as good
a fellow as any since the day when Father Abraham
was himself a heathen in the land of the Chaldees.
I have mingled much with the Greeks in Jerusalem
without giving them a chance to cut my
throat. I have been more than once, as you know,
in this palace when Apollonius was its master. I
have learned much of Dion from the lips of his fellows
in camp and field. He was the pride of the
Greek service; could have had high rank, but he
risked it all for the safety of Deborah. He won her
gratitude by saving her from foul dealing. I say,
Jew that I am, Deborah ought to love Dion. And,
further, I will say that Deborah ought not, and
will not, marry Judas. It was not alone for the
benefit of foreign alliance that I spoke of our brother
seeking a wife from the courts of other nations; I
foresaw that he could not marry within Judaism,
since he would marry none save Deborah; and she
is an impossibility, unless I know nothing of the
soul of this woman. Now mark me further, my
over-wise Simon. Did you not note that when
Judas was brooding over the kingship he went to
the house of Elkiah? And since his return he has
been behind what you call his thunder-cloud. I tell
you that when Judas' lightning flashes, it will not
be with the light of statecraft, but against Dion.
Judas, generous, self-yielding, patriotic, is one man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Judas in love is a different man. I would that the
Greek were far away from Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Judas still sat by his table. The light faded in
the high window beneath the cedar rafters of the
great chamber. A star gleamed through the aperture,
then floated on to look into a million other
chambers where men and women sat with bowed
heads or lay upon restless couches. The moon
looked in, and hung her white veil on this wall of
the chamber, and then on that, but evoked no response
from Judas, except an occasional smile that
relieved the harshness of his features.</p>

<p>By and by the sun rose. Jonathan came and saw
him fast asleep with his head resting on his clasped
hands. When his brother woke him, his face showed
the marks of suffering. Years seemed to have put
wrinkles about his eyes and mouth, as time cracks
timber and lime walls and almost everything else.
Why not a man's face?</p>

<p>Judas ate a little of the meal which the servants
brought, responding only in briefest words to their
questions. Then, as if a spring had uncoiled somewhere
within his body, he suddenly rose.</p>

<p>"Brother Jonathan, bring the Captains here at the
sixth hour&mdash;and the Priests at the ninth; for we
have pressing business to-day."</p>

<p>Without another word he passed through the great
doorway into the palace plaza, and thence into the
street.</p>

<p>"What news?" asked a guard. "Maccabæus is as
wrathful this morning as a starved lion. Are the
Syrians marching again upon the city?"</p>

<p>"If not, then the devil has broken loose, and challenged
our Goliath to fight. The Lord have mercy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
on the man he runs against this time! Look at
him! The very stones shake under his feet."</p>

<p>Judas turned into a by-street. He stopped before
a small building. He did not wait to have his
heavy rap on the door answered from within, but
entered, and went straight to a side chamber.</p>

<p>"Captain Dion!" he thundered out.</p>

<p>He was confronted by both Agathocles and Dion.
The presence of the Greek General seemed to remind
him of his forgotten courtesy.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, sirs! But I would talk to this
man alone."</p>

<p>Agathocles withdrew, but not without a wondering
glance at their unceremonious visitor and a look
of inquiry at Dion, who, however, was as amazed
as his companion.</p>

<p>When they were alone, and the door closed, Judas
said:</p>

<p>"Dion, I once took your oath of allegiance at the
gate."</p>

<p>"True. And the oath has not been broken," replied
the young man, with some resentment in his
tone excited by the apparent suspicion in Judas'
abrupt manner.</p>

<p>In loud voice Judas exclaimed: "As Dion the Greek
you have kept your oath; but that is no longer
binding; for you are not Dion, but Gershom ben
Shattuck. As a Jew you have sworn no allegiance."</p>

<p>"Do the Jews swear allegiance to their commander?"
replied he. "Are we like the Romans? Is it
not enough that our allegiance is to the Lord, who
is over us all? Did Judas ever before ask an oath
of any Jew to serve him?"</p>

<p>"From no other man," said Judas; "but from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
son of Shattuck I would require it. The Jews would
make me King of Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"And rightly," responded the other. "And to King
Maccabæus I will swear to be loyal in everything
that man should do for man."</p>

<p>Judas repeated his words, "'Everything that man
should do for man.' A wise and well-turned oath.
I like it. Shattuck, they would make Elkiah's
daughter the Queen of Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Dion staggered as if the Maccabæan had smitten
him. But he quickly recovered his self-possession.
He spoke slowly:</p>

<p>"Maccabæus, I will swear loyalty to Elkiah's
daughter as Queen,&mdash;when she shall ask it of me.
But until she herself speaks that word no man,
though he be Maccabæus, shall exact it from me.
At her feet I will take the vow, but not under any
man's hand. You have my answer."</p>

<p>Shattuck's form seemed swollen with his wrath
until it matched that of the giant who confronted
him. Judas looked at his challenger as a lion-tamer
might have returned the wild glare of his beast
which he knows must succumb to his own dominant
will. Yet there was in his eyes the flicker as
of a light that came from some deeper recess of his
soul than that of his present passion. A smile
quickly overspread his features. He laid his great
hand on the shoulder of his competitor.</p>

<p>"Dion&mdash;Ben Shattuck&mdash;though I be King, as man
to man, we stand on equal footing. Your challenge
proves it. But, if you had sworn allegiance
to me in putting the crown upon the head of Elkiah's
daughter without her command, I would
have felled you in your tracks. Here we stand&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>man
and man; and that woman is the queen of us
both. You have been her protector. I know all
the story of these years. Protect her still from Greek
and from Jew. I swear with you, Shattuck, that
no will but her own shall be over her. Come with
me to her."</p>

<p>The two men went together into the Street of
David, and entered the house of Elkiah. As Deborah
glanced from one to the other, Judas seized her
hand and placed it in Dion's,</p>

<p>"The God of Israel bless you both!" he said.</p>

<p>Before they could find voice to reply Judas was
gone.</p>

<p>As he came out into the street Meph met him
with the great news.</p>

<p>"Dion is a Jew! Dion is a Jew! My old Sirach
was right. Deborah herself told me. And, Judas,
she was as glad as I was to find it out, almost."</p>

<h2>LI<br />

<span class="smaller">A KING, INDEED</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-w2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Judas returned to his palace he
found his brethren in waiting. Their
manner told the anxiety with which
they anticipated his decision of the
momentous question of the kingship.
Judas relieved them of the necessity of putting their
thoughts into words.</p>

<p>"Do you still believe that I should be King?"</p>

<p>"It is the will of the nation," said Simon.</p>

<p>"And yours?"</p>

<p>"And ours," said all, making low obeisance.</p>

<p>"You swear me absolute obedience?"</p>

<p>"Obedience absolute. There can be no other sort
of kingship."</p>

<p>One by one his brethren took his hand; then
ranged in a circle about him. There was no need of
a crown to give majesty to this man: his form
towering; his face imperious; and around him the
very atmosphere almost visibly radiant with the
prestige of victories such as Heaven had never before
given to man. Nor did his brethren need princely
robing to make them feel due pride in this hour of
the founding of the new Dynasty.</p>

<p>"I thank you, my brothers, worthy all of the
blood of our father Mattathias. Hear, then, my
command. I exact no vow, but trust your love to
guard your loyalty."</p>

<p>"Our brother's word is our law," said Simon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>"His word our law," went round the little circle.</p>

<p>"Gather close about me," said Judas.</p>

<p>Then lowering his voice: "This is my will. Let the
word King never again be heard in our council.
Nor let the daughter of Elkiah be spoken of except
as the wife of Gershom ben Shattuck."</p>

<p>"Ben Shattuck!"</p>

<p>The exclamation burst vehemently from all lips.</p>

<p>Judas had no need to explain his words; for at the
moment Meph's voice rang across the plaza:</p>

<p>"Dion is a Jew! Dion is a Jew! The son of
Agathocles is the son of Shattuck."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Judas left little time for any to dispute his decision.
His tremendous energy was imparted to every
man about him. Priests were loaded with questions
regarding their ancient customs, which absorbed
their study day and night, for Judas would immediately
reorganize their order according to the
Aaronic ideal. Such artisans as were still to be
found among the people, builders in stone, carvers of
wood, and women skilled in needlework, were given
their part in the problem of the renovation of the
Temple. The city walls were to be strengthened,
new citadels built in the surrounding villages, cordons
of forts placed around the entire land, the army
to be reorganized for more systematic defence, and
new campaigns planned to effectually awe the surrounding
tribesmen.</p>

<p>Every day saw the mark of the master-hand of
their leader. The rubbish heaps outside the gates
were ornamented with the shattered pieces of pagan
statuary. The sacred courts on Mount Moriah were
purged of every stain of the heathen Abomination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
A new altar rose on the site of the ancient one. Its
stones were untouched by chisel, only laid together
symmetrically, as befitted a memorial to Him who
created all things without the help of human hands.
The stones of the ancient altar, which had been
desecrated by the foul offerings of the Greeks, were
laid away until the great Messiah should come.</p>

<p>The crowning act of Greek pollution had taken
place three years before, on the twenty-fifth day of
the month Chisleu, which corresponds with the
Roman month of December. Judas appointed the
same date for the Feast of Dedication, which has
been annually repeated ever since throughout the
Jewish world.</p>

<p>For eight days the streets of the city and all the
highways leading to its gates from valley and hill
were thronged with processions bearing palm
branches, and shouting the old Hallel psalms. In
many groups were those who had not touched hands
for years; men who had come out of hiding-places
where they had taken covert from the incessant persecution.
Some came laden with their goods, making
willing offerings of coins and jewels to swell the
fund for the glorious work.</p>

<p>At each nightfall every house gleamed like a constellation
with crowded lights in doorway and window,
and on parapet and dome. The Temple plaza
blazed with great fires which sent beams of hope
far over the Judean hills, and by the glare in the
sky proclaimed the triumph of Israel to the camps
of the enemy beyond the borders.</p>

<p>One house outshone all other private dwellings on
the third night of the Feast of Dedication. It stood
near to the western gate, close by the Tower of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
David, with the city's breadth separating it from the
Temple. The fires on the roof of this house saluted
as with waving hands of flame the blazing glory of
the Temple Mount. This was the old mansion of
Shattuck, for years deserted, but now reoccupied by
its new-found inheritor.</p>

<p>Between this house and that of Elkiah the streets
were densely crowded on that third night. At the
middle hour a cry rent the air:</p>

<p>"She comes! She comes!"</p>

<p>Close back against the houses the people were
massed. There was no need of official command, for
the populace was moved by a common gladness and
reverence.</p>

<p>There was but one instance of what would have
seemed to a stranger a breach of decorum. Down
the street came Meph waving his crutch like the
baton of a marshal, and shouting:</p>

<p>"Make way! Make way for the Daughter of
Jerusalem! Way for the bride of Ben Shattuck!"</p>

<p>No one rebuked the lad, for the story of his part
in bringing about the regeneration of the popular
Greek into a Jew was well known. "Bless the boy!"
was the only comment heard as his heels conducted
both himself and the pageant that followed.</p>

<p>The procession was more artistically heralded by
bands of players on flute and tabor, succeeded by
those leading the multitude in the ancient marriage
song of the people.</p>

<p>Amid a hundred torches was seen the gigantic
form of Judas together with his brethren. For this
hour at least all traces of solemnity and care were
banished from his face, as he led the "friends of the
bridegroom," who, according to the time-honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
custom, were conducting the bride to the house of
her husband.</p>

<p>As Deborah appeared surrounded by her maidens
the cries, "Long live Judas Maccabæus!" were
quickly changed.</p>

<p>"Joy! joy to the daughter of Elkiah! Long live
Deborah, the Daughter of Jerusalem!" rang from a
thousand lips.</p>

<p>The happy crowd hurried along as if impelled by
their own huzzas, until the bride disappeared within
the portal of the house of Shattuck.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later Judas sat alone in his chamber in
the palace on Sion. The stars as they floated by
looked through the high window, but did not disturb
the soul which at that hour was moving
through depths as profound as theirs. The gray
dawn alone aroused him&mdash;in which there was a
poetic propriety; for since the day-spring summons
all nature to activity, why should it not awaken
the tremendous forces of this great heart for its
work in resurrecting a nation?</p>

<p>Judas reached out his hand and struck the bronze
gong&mdash;the same that Apollonius had rung three
years before when he was vanquished by the spirit
of Deborah in this same hall.</p>

<p>"Call the Captains!"</p>

<p>His chief officers came with evidence of hasty toilet&mdash;for
celerity never waited upon formality in the
councils of Judas. His sentences, as he addressed
them, were laconic, as if he assumed that his hearers
had listened at his brain and already knew
his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Friends, I learn that the men of Edom are mov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>ing
from their camps on the south. The tribesmen
of the Jordan and beyond are preparing to strike
us. Tyre and Sidon are enrolling their trained
bands. Every man, then, in readiness by the turn
of the moon!"</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand he dismissed them.</p>

<p>The result of this order belongs to history, which
tells how the invincible men of Judas, beginning
on the south, swung to east, then from east
to north, then from north to west, and then from
west to south again&mdash;the swing of the mighty Hammer
of Israel&mdash;crushing a hostile tribe at every
stroke, until Judah lay quiet within all its desolate
borders.</p>

<p>No sword gleamed brighter in those days than
that of Gershom ben Shattuck, and no foeman gave
more desperate battle than Nadan, son of Yusef,
Sheikh of Jericho.</p>

<div class="mt4 blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Judas fell in battle three years later. The still sceptreless
rule was then taken by Jonathan, who, with the title of
High Priest, consolidated the religious and secular orders, and
laid wide and deep the foundation of the Asmonean power&mdash;a title
taken from the family name of Mattathias, the father of the
Maccabees. On the death of Jonathan, Simon the Wise accomplished
his purpose of kingship for Israel, and crowned himself.
In the seed of Simon the dynasty endured until the last
diluted drops of Maccabæan blood drained from the veins of the
Herods, and the eyes of the world were turned to one whom
they called, not Messiah Malhamah, "The Anointed for War,"
but Christ, "The Prince of Peace."</p>

<p>For the descriptions of the battles of Judas mentioned in this
book the writer has been compelled to supplement with his own
imagination very meagre historic materials. The place of the
fight with Apollonius (The Wady) is unidentified by chroniclers.
The affair at Bethhoron follows only the general topography of
the region. The stratagem of Judas at Emmaus is, however,
well known, and was imitated by Bonaparte. The method of
"The Hammer" at Bethzur cannot have differed greatly from
that described. The result of all these battles is as historic as it
was marvellous.</p>

<p>If injustice has been done to any of the real characters involved,
Antiochus Epiphanes, Mattathias and his five sons, the priest
Menelaos, or the various generals commanding the hosts overthrown
by the heroic patriots, the writer is prepared to make the
personal <i>amende honorable</i> if he should ever meet them in the
shades.</p>

<p>For the other characters, Deborah and Dion, Caleb and Meph,
it is sufficient to say that they are the children of his own fancy,
over whom he exercises the ancient paternal right of absolute disposal.
Of Glaucon and Clarissa, the report that Agathocles, on
his return to Antioch, met them as the keepers of a wine shop
near the bridge over the Orontes, is as true as were all the other
declarations of that veracious Greek.</p>

<p>The student of the Maccabæan period may profitably consult the
Books of the Maccabees in the Apocryphal Bible (for traditional
accounts); "The Histories of Polybius" (for contemporaneous
history of other nations); Prideaux's "Connections of Old and
New Testaments" (for relation of Jews and Gentiles); Stanley's
"Jewish Church," volume iii. (for summary of men and events);

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
